         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Focus on capturing the essence of the cluster in a way that is informative and specific.\\nAlways answer in English and use title case for the labels (e.g., \"Climate Change\", \"Artificial Intelligence\").\\nOutput the results as a JSON object where each key is the original cluster id and each value is the generated label for that cluster.\\nDo not include any additional text or explanation in your response, neither before nor after the JSON object, as headers, titles or footers.

         "In this special episode of Intelligence Matters , host Michael Morell speaks with Stephen Hadley , the CIA 's most senior analyst on 9/11 , about his experience on that day .\nWiley and Morell discuss the CIA 's pre-9/11 focus on al Qaeda how the agency immediately surged resources to counterterrorism efforts after the attacks occurred .\nThey also discuss recent developments in Afghanistan , including the Taliban 's takeover of Kabul .\nAhead of the twentieth anniversary of the September 11th attacks , Morell will curate a series of conversations with former senior American officials who had notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and its immediate aftermath .\nMorell , who served as President George W. Bush 's daily intelligence briefer and was traveling with the president on the day the planes hit the towers , will also share personal reflections and new details about the CIA 's race to provide answers and protect the country from further terror attacks .\nThe series will launch the week of August 9 and run for five weeks , with its first episode premiering on August 11 , 2021 and its final episode running on September 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attacks : `` I 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , or for us as individuals . ''\nTracking al Qaeda before 9/11 : `` We 'd been worried about al-Qaeda as a group from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against al-Qaeda , I think was the beginning of a large and growing effort ... We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

'' download , rate and subscribe here : itunes , spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to intelligence matters . it is very good to have you on the show . and much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again . winston wiley : good to talk to you . michael morell : so , winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , i wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career . and one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that i would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me . and i do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to hawaii . and i had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday . i really took that to heart . and for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pdb staff , briefing the president , serving overseas . and i just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and i think should be important to them . winston wiley : oh , well , thank you for remembering that . i do n't remember in as much details as you just made . it 's consistent with what i believe and what i tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place . i saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better . so my time in ctc and then coming back to be addi and adci for homeland security was kind of true to that . and i and i tried to share that with as many people as possible . and i 'm glad you found it useful . michael morell : i listened . i actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory . before we talk about 9/11 , i 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 . we 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later . but but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ? winston wiley : ok. well , you know , how did i wind up with the agency is pretty easy . i was born into it . my dad was not in o.s.s . but was a charter member of cia when it was formed in '47 . and the time i was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , i went to american university and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family . i then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that i 'd have a career in operations . but i found my interim assignments and the directorate of intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old office of current intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the near east and south asian analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late bob ames and helene boatner . worked for them until 1985 or so . then i went to the office of global issues as a deputy to david carey , who later became executive director of the agency . i worked for dave four or five times . and got my first division assignment running the international issues division in ogi . and i did that for five years . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ig staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for bob layton and the office of near east south asian analysis , as head of the persian gulf division . and that 's where i was when on the day saddam invaded kuwait in 1991 . worked through 1992 on running persian gulf division and found time to look for another job after five years at nesa and was asked to become the deputy in the in the counterterrorism center . the center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst . and i got to work with steve ahr as his deputy for two years . steve moved up to be the chief of the ne division and i took over as chief of ctc . and brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order . and i spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where i found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence . michael morell : so , winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence . you were in charge of all the analysts . you were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 . can you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ? winston wiley : well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out . we write the first draft and put to bed the president 's daily brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those . in the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the di . and my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible . michael morell ?

we had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate . my immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing ctc analytic firepower . and i remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , i think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to ctc and created an office of terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center . michael morell : so , in fact , you moved , i think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts . michael morell : yeah . and i remember entire teams . right . teams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken . winston wiley : well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one . they would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated . we asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be . and i gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that . but the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases i think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible . there were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the fbi stand up its new analytic capability . the president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to cia for help in . and you provided it . winston wiley : well , i 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the fbi counterterrorism folks during my time in ctc , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while . and , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help . it was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts . that was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the ctc . but we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities . it 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing . the analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was . so it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business . michael morell : so , yeah , and then i think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which i think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ? winston wiley : yeah . when you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground.. many , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work . and i think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small . but that is a labor intensive task . michael morell : so sometime after 9/11 , george tenet , the director of central intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position . can you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in june of the following year , the director asked if i would stand up a position , called the associate director for homeland security . by then the white house had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level department of homeland security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue . as adci , he asked not that i assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homeland security , but that i use the background and knowledge that i had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort . i added one deputy from the ops directorate at cia , another deputy from nsa , one from dia and one from nsa , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities . at the time , the dci had both cia and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point . and so with the creation of ctc those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side . and , you know , i think even if you worked in that environment for a while . michael morell : so , winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u.s. government brought osama bin laden to justice on may 1st , 2011 . what was your reaction ? what was your reaction when you heard that ? winston wiley : elation . just , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever i was watching , there was really only one thing i could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , i watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated . michael morell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , i want you to compare it to the bringing of mir aimal kanzi to justice . i think you were at dulles airport , along with director tenet when the fbi returned him to the united states from pakistan . and maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there . winston wiley : well , mir aimal kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three . that began - at the time i was the relatively new deputy director in ctc and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work . and i was in ctc for five years after that . and every night before i left , i got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for mir aimal kanzi . without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the fbi was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the united states to be turned over to virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here . i was asked along with many others , if i wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , i would not have missed it . i wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers . i saw him march by on the arms of brad garrett , the lead fbi officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers . but brad marched them from the air force plane that brought him into dulles airport , because it was in virginia and in the same fairfax county district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ? it was n't elation at all . it was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when i saw , 'wow , what a weaselly little character he was . ' micahel morell : winston , i would n't be doing my job if i did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course . we 're taping this the day after kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the taliban won . and i 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday . winston wiley : michael , it 's too soon . i 've been you know , i 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment . it will change us . i hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : i 'm winston , maybe just one more question , and i was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about bob ames . yes . and you talked about working for him when he was running the near east south asia office . and i would bet most of my listeners do n't know about bob . and i was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened . since we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the middle east , there is a book that was written by kai bird about him , 'the perfect spy ' by kai bird . to all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read . bob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people i 've met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle east . and director casey asked him to take over nesa and one of the very few people that i recall , having served as both the director of a di office and in a senior position . and as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building . his loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man . i think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency . and we lost him far too young an age . michael morell : winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Global Elite Use 3 Giant Financial Companies To Control 88% Of The Corporations Listed On The S&P 500",
         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

         "global elite use 3 giant financial companies to control 88% of the corporations listed on the s&p 500. there is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today . they control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use . tens of millions of americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries . but of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the s & p 500 . the three financial companies that i am talking about are blackrock , vanguard and state street . according to cnn , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… but that is actually an old number . i wanted to come up with a newer number , and so i started digging . according to wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of january 2021… vanguard is nearly as big . according to wikipedia , vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of january 2021… while not as large as the other two , state street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year . easiest way to get your first bitcoin ( ad ) so adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in january 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now . that is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine . sometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is . if you were alive when jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet . collectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the s & p 500… being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power . for example , last month blackrock and vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on exxonmobil ’ s board of directors… blackrock and vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on exxonmobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting . the two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of exxonmobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a engine no . 1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees exxonmobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk . engine no . 1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry . exxonmobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them . and these new board members will help to ensure that exxonmobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite . for those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe . in fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do . unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners . at this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top . if you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks . we need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” . because even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society . america ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power . today , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing . in fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this . and don ’ t expect our politicians in washington to do anything . they want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on wall street . ***michael ’ s new

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the

'' download , rate and subscribe here : itunes , spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to intelligence matters . it is very good to have you on the show . and much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again . winston wiley : good to talk to you . michael morell : so , winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , i wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career . and one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that i would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me . and i do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to hawaii . and i had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday . i really took that to heart . and for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pdb staff , briefing the president , serving overseas . and i just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and i think should be important to them . winston wiley : oh , well , thank you for remembering that . i do n't remember in as much details as you just made . it 's consistent with what i believe and what i tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place . i saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better . so my time in ctc and then coming back to be addi and adci for homeland security was kind of true to that . and i and i tried to share that with as many people as possible . and i 'm glad you found it useful . michael morell : i listened . i actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory . before we talk about 9/11 , i 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 . we 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later . but but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ? winston wiley : ok. well , you know , how did i wind up with the agency is pretty easy . i was born into it . my dad was not in o.s.s . but was a charter member of cia when it was formed in '47 . and the time i was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , i went to american university and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family . i then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that i 'd have a career in operations . but i found my interim assignments and the directorate of intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old office of current intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the near east and south asian analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late bob ames and helene boatner . worked for them until 1985 or so . then i went to the office of global issues as a deputy to david carey , who later became executive director of the agency . i worked for dave four or five times . and got my first division assignment running the international issues division in ogi . and i did that for five years . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ig staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for bob layton and the office of near east south asian analysis , as head of the persian gulf division . and that 's where i was when on the day saddam invaded kuwait in 1991 . worked through 1992 on running persian gulf division and found time to look for another job after five years at nesa and was asked to become the deputy in the in the counterterrorism center . the center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst . and i got to work with steve ahr as his deputy for two years . steve moved up to be the chief of the ne division and i took over as chief of ctc . and brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order . and i spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where i found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence . michael morell : so , winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence . you were in charge of all the analysts . you were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 . can you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ? winston wiley : well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out . we write the first draft and put to bed the president 's daily brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those . in the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the di . and my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible . michael morell ? winston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in ctc and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ? how were you thinking about that ? winston wiley : well , we 'd been worried about al-qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew . while i was still in ctc , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort . really with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al qaeda as a group . we tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one . after 9/11 , that changed . michael morell : ok , winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ? i know you did not plan to come to work that day . can you walk us through it for us ? winston wiley : well . indeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at bwi airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to california @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the united states as the attacks were going on . i 'll never forget the phone call i got as i was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the world trade center . i sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morell : so i suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ? winston wiley : yes . i knew it in my bones . it did n't require me to sit down and ponder . a single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident . a second , no sir . you know , i ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise . winston wiley : it would have to have been at the top of the list . a coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the pentagon and later understanding what happened in shanksville . there just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that . michael morell : so what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ? winston wiley : surprisingly , very , very little . when i went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate . at that point . i was directed towards the security guy who told me i needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - i went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand . an unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to bwi michael morell : and did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ? winston wiley : i got to the gate . and i had told them , you know , 'you guys are n't flying today . ' the word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled . i was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you took them home . and did you come to work then ? winston wiley : well , i took them home . but you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home . and that was just a solid jam . i turned around and went to the baltimore washington parkway and took that down . it took a lifetime of living in the washington area , knowing back roads to get to places . all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower pennsylvania , delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the pentagon fire . and i guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where i rejoined my deputies and george and others . i was in touch by phone . the team knew very well what to do , if nothing else . i mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus . and the team fell back on that . and , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support . i think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period . leave it to him to decide . michael morell : so , winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? well , i 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could . what that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-qaida and its supporters ? we had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate . my immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing ctc analytic firepower . and i remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , i think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to ctc and created an office of terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center . michael morell : so , in fact , you moved , i think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts . michael morell : yeah . and i remember entire teams . right . teams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken . winston wiley : well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one . they would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated . we asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be . and i gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that . but the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases i think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible . there were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the fbi stand up its new analytic capability . the president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to cia for help in . and you provided it . winston wiley : well , i 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the fbi counterterrorism folks during my time in ctc , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while . and , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help . it was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts . that was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the ctc . but we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities . it 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing . the analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was . so it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business . michael morell : so , yeah , and then i think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which i think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ? winston wiley : yeah . when you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground.. many , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work . and i think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small . but that is a labor intensive task . michael morell : so sometime after 9/11 , george tenet , the director of central intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position . can you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in june of the following year , the director asked if i would stand up a position , called the associate director for homeland security . by then the white house had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level department of homeland security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue . as adci , he asked not that i assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homeland security , but that i use the background and knowledge that i had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort . i added one deputy from the ops directorate at cia , another deputy from nsa , one from dia and one from nsa , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities . at the time , the dci had both cia and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point . and so with the creation of ctc those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side . and , you know , i think even if you worked in that environment for a while . michael morell : so , winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u.s. government brought osama bin laden to justice on may 1st , 2011 . what was your reaction ? what was your reaction when you heard that ? winston wiley : elation . just , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever i was watching , there was really only one thing i could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , i watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated . michael morell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , i want you to compare it to the bringing of mir aimal kanzi to justice . i think you were at dulles airport , along with director tenet when the fbi returned him to the united states from pakistan . and maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there . winston wiley : well , mir aimal kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three . that began - at the time i was the relatively new deputy director in ctc and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work . and i was in ctc for five years after that . and every night before i left , i got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for mir aimal kanzi . without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the fbi was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the united states to be turned over to virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here . i was asked along with many others , if i wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , i would not have missed it . i wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers . i saw him march by on the arms of brad garrett , the lead fbi officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers . but brad marched them from the air force plane that brought him into dulles airport , because it was in virginia and in the same fairfax county district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ? it was n't elation at all . it was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when i saw , 'wow , what a weaselly little character he was . ' micahel morell : winston , i would n't be doing my job if i did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course . we 're taping this the day after kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the taliban won . and i 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday . winston wiley : michael , it 's too soon . i 've been you know , i 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment . it will change us . i hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : i 'm winston , maybe just one more question , and i was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about bob ames . yes . and you talked about working for him when he was running the near east south asia office . and i would bet most of my listeners do n't know about bob . and i was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened . since we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the middle east , there is a book that was written by kai bird about him , 'the perfect spy ' by kai bird . to all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read . bob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people i 've met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle east . and director casey asked him to take over nesa and one of the very few people that i recall , having served as both the director of a di office and in a senior position . and as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building . his loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man . i think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency . and we lost him far too young an age . michael morell : winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

you ’ ve got to keep on trucking , and that gives you even more incentive next year , ” baker said . “ it ’ s tough to take now , but this too shall pass . i mean , it really hurts , but it ’ s over , ” he added . major credit for the braves , too , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acuña ’ s knee injury , he pulled off a flurry of july trades that brought the fab four to the outfield — nl championship series mvp eddie rosario , adam duvall , joc pederson and soler . but even in the analytics era , guided by a gm fully versed in new-age ways , the path these braves took wouldn ’ t add up in any computer . especially with how things looked in midseason . “ at that time , we were searching , ” third baseman austin riley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ’ s no question about that. ” minus acuña , atlanta wasn ’ t over .500 for a single day until the first week in august . the braves finished 88-73 for the 12th-best record in the majors and fewest victories among playoff teams ; their win total was the lowest for a world series champion since st. louis ’ 83 in 2006 . plus , some agonizing history in atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 . the braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the dodgers in the nlcs last year . the hawks fell short in the eastern conference finals last season . and then there was the big one , the falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the patriots in the super bowl . but these braves , not this time . favored in spring training to win their fourth straight nl east title , the braves lost acuña to a torn knee in july . earlier , 2020 triple crown contender marcell ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy . projected ace mike soroka never got back from an achilles injury . going into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork . they had a guy who made his big league debut in october , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the texas airhogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago . toss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against jose altuve and the houston crew . many continue to heckle them as the “ cheatin ’ astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever . certainly a lot of people were cheering for baker . a world series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century . the 1995 atlanta champs featured five future hall of famers — rookie chipper jones , aces tom glavine , greg maddux and john smoltz , and manager bobby cox . those rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles . the 1957 milwaukee braves were led by aaron in his only nl mvp season . his 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at truist park , and baker and snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 boston braves , too , dubbed the “ miracle braves ” back in the day . in last place on the fourth of july , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the philadelphia a ’ s — to earn their nickname . the braves ’ previous title came at atlanta-fulton county stadium , their first home after moving from milwaukee to the deep south in 1966 . then there was turner field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled minute maid park . quite a change from last october . only a limited capacity was permitted for that world series as the dodgers beat tampa bay at a neutral-site stadium in arlington , texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus . now , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months . a squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . in the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal . astros : scheduled to start the spring training schedule on feb. 26 vs. st. louis .",

We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

'' download , rate and subscribe here : itunes , spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to intelligence matters . it is very good to have you on the show . and much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again . winston wiley : good to talk to you . michael morell : so , winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , i wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career . and one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that i would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me . and i do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to hawaii . and i had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday . i really took that to heart . and for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pdb staff , briefing the president , serving overseas . and i just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and i think should be important to them . winston wiley : oh , well , thank you for remembering that . i do n't remember in as much details as you just made . it 's consistent with what i believe and what i tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place . i saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better . so my time in ctc and then coming back to be addi and adci for homeland security was kind of true to that . and i and i tried to share that with as many people as possible . and i 'm glad you found it useful . michael morell : i listened . i actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory . before we talk about 9/11 , i 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 . we 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later . but but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ? winston wiley : ok. well , you know , how did i wind up with the agency is pretty easy . i was born into it . my dad was not in o.s.s . but was a charter member of cia when it was formed in '47 . and the time i was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , i went to american university and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family . i then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that i 'd have a career in operations . but i found my interim assignments and the directorate of intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old office of current intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the near east and south asian analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late bob ames and helene boatner . worked for them until 1985 or so . then i went to the office of global issues as a deputy to david carey , who later became executive director of the agency . i worked for dave four or five times . and got my first division assignment running the international issues division in ogi . and i did that for five years . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ig staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for bob layton and the office of near east south asian analysis , as head of the persian gulf division . and that 's where i was when on the day saddam invaded kuwait in 1991 . worked through 1992 on running persian gulf division and found time to look for another job after five years at nesa and was asked to become the deputy in the in the counterterrorism center . the center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst . and i got to work with steve ahr as his deputy for two years . steve moved up to be the chief of the ne division and i took over as chief of ctc . and brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order . and i spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where i found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence . michael morell : so , winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence . you were in charge of all the analysts . you were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 . can you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ? winston wiley : well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out . we write the first draft and put to bed the president 's daily brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those . in the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the di . and my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible . michael morell ? winston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in ctc and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ? how were you thinking about that ? winston wiley : well , we 'd been worried about al-qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew . while i was still in ctc , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort . really with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al qaeda as a group . we tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one . after 9/11 , that changed . michael morell : ok , winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ? i know you did not plan to come to work that day . can you walk us through it for us ? winston wiley : well . indeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at bwi airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to california @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the united states as the attacks were going on . i 'll never forget the phone call i got as i was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the world trade center . i sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morell : so i suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?

winston wiley : surprisingly , very , very little . when i went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate . at that point . i was directed towards the security guy who told me i needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - i went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand . an unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to bwi michael morell : and did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ? winston wiley : i got to the gate . and i had told them , you know , 'you guys are n't flying today . ' the word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled . i was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you took them home . and did you come to work then ? winston wiley : well , i took them home . but you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home . and that was just a solid jam . i turned around and went to the baltimore washington parkway and took that down . it took a lifetime of living in the washington area , knowing back roads to get to places . all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower pennsylvania , delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the pentagon fire . and i guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where i rejoined my deputies and george and others . i was in touch by phone . the team knew very well what to do , if nothing else . i mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus . and the team fell back on that . and , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support . i think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period . leave it to him to decide . michael morell : so , winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?

winston wiley : yeah . when you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground.. many , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work . and i think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small . but that is a labor intensive task . michael morell : so sometime after 9/11 , george tenet , the director of central intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position . can you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in june of the following year , the director asked if i would stand up a position , called the associate director for homeland security . by then the white house had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level department of homeland security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue . as adci , he asked not that i assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homeland security , but that i use the background and knowledge that i had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort . i added one deputy from the ops directorate at cia , another deputy from nsa , one from dia and one from nsa , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities . at the time , the dci had both cia and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point . and so with the creation of ctc those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side . and , you know , i think even if you worked in that environment for a while . michael morell : so , winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u.s. government brought osama bin laden to justice on may 1st , 2011 . what was your reaction ? what was your reaction when you heard that ? winston wiley : elation . just , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever i was watching , there was really only one thing i could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , i watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated . michael morell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , i want you to compare it to the bringing of mir aimal kanzi to justice . i think you were at dulles airport , along with director tenet when the fbi returned him to the united states from pakistan . and maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there . winston wiley : well , mir aimal kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three . that began - at the time i was the relatively new deputy director in ctc and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work . and i was in ctc for five years after that . and every night before i left , i got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for mir aimal kanzi . without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the fbi was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the united states to be turned over to virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here . i was asked along with many others , if i wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , i would not have missed it . i wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers . i saw him march by on the arms of brad garrett , the lead fbi officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers . but brad marched them from the air force plane that brought him into dulles airport , because it was in virginia and in the same fairfax county district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ? it was n't elation at all . it was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when i saw , 'wow , what a weaselly little character he was . ' micahel morell : winston , i would n't be doing my job if i did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course . we 're taping this the day after kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the taliban won . and i 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday . winston wiley : michael , it 's too soon . i 've been you know , i 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment . it will change us . i hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : i 'm winston , maybe just one more question , and i was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about bob ames . yes . and you talked about working for him when he was running the near east south asia office . and i would bet most of my listeners do n't know about bob . and i was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened . since we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the middle east , there is a book that was written by kai bird about him , 'the perfect spy ' by kai bird . to all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read . bob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people i 've met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle east . and director casey asked him to take over nesa and one of the very few people that i recall , having served as both the director of a di office and in a senior position . and as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building . his loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man . i think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency . and we lost him far too young an age . michael morell : winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",
