         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

anticipated SAVANNAH , Ga. -- When salvage crews began cutting apart the capsized Golden Ray , a shipwreck the size of a 70-story office building with 4,200 cars within its cargo decks , in early

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Global Elite Use 3 Giant Financial Companies To Control 88% Of The Corporations Listed On The S&P 500",
         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon .\n*** About the Author : My name is Michael Snyder and my brand new book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of America ” is now available on Amazon.com .\nIn addition

         "Global Elite Use 3 Giant Financial Companies To Control 88% Of The Corporations Listed On The S&P 500. There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon .\n*** About the Author : My name is Michael Snyder and my brand new book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of America ” is now available on Amazon.com .\nIn addition to my new book , I have written four others that are available on Amazon.com including The Beginning Of The End , Get Prepared Now , and Living A Life That Really Matters .\n( # CommissionsEarned ) By

We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

@ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Government Paying Americans Not To Work … Biden Insists That’s Not A Problem. I was chatting with my barber the other day and inquired why there ’ d been such a long wait for a spot in the chair that morning .\nHer reply was unexpectedly mordant — and blunt : Only one person had been available to do the cutting when the shop opened because “ we can ’ t get anyone to work.\n” “ Don ’ t you know that ’ s a myth ?\n” I replied ironically .\nShe smirked and continued clipping away .\nThese days George Orwell is every conservative ’ s go-to guy for punchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a “ right-winger ” himself — by his own assertion , in fact , a “ democratic socialist ” .\nThat doesn ’ t mean he ’ d be enamored with the likes of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi .\nIt ’ s plausible he ’ d be horrified by most contemporary Western liberals .\nOr Democrats .\nRecall , Orwell is the celebrated epigrammarian who first said , “ the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.\n” In this regard , the above Leftists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as “ anti-Orwells ” .\nThey seem fixated on dismissing , even disguising , the glaringly self-evident about so much ; unemployment numbers included .\nOf course , for exhibit A I have in mind President Joe Biden .\nAfter two disappointing monthly job reports in a row — April ’ s downright catastrophically so — he ’ s unshakably assured us there ’ s zilch truth to the charge that millions of unemployed Americans are forgoing an employment search because COVID-19 relief payments are making it more lucrative to remain loitering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s been a lot of discussion … that people are being paid to stay home rather than go to work , ” admitted the Chief Exec .\nBut then : “ Well , we don ’ t see much evidence of that.\n” Despite abysmal job-creation stats , Biden scoffed at what he waved off as “ loose talk that Americans just don ’ t want to work.\n” So , that settles the economic debate , Mr. President ?\nPoint of fact , anecdotal indicators and a trove of collected data ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) signal there is , indeed , a hiring problem .\nThis also tracks with common sense : as my father has said , “ Pay people not to work and they won ’ t work.\n” That truism isn ’ t rendered inoperative just because the “ don ’ t work ” payments are gussied up as “ COVID-relief ” .\nOr because our forty-sixth president says it ain ’ t so .\nExperience affirms you generally get more of what you subsidize financially — in this latest case , we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gladly cooperating .\nThe editors at National Review put it this way in their June 1 edition : “ One thing the government is good at doing is getting more of what it pays for : in this case , idleness.\n” As with everything in life , there are doubtless exceptions to this pattern , but it does appear to be a genuine , broad and regrettably debilitating phenomenon .\nApplying some available street smarts to the matter should have predicted all this long ago .\nWe are seeing the debasement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the economic front .\n… All the Biden folks needed to do was stop gazing into their cracked crystal ball and go outside and ask business owners if they can find workers .\n… Instead , the liberals paid attention to some cockamamie econometric model saying you can pay people more not to work and it won ’ t change their behavior .\nBrilliant .\n… Here is a simple , ironclad law of economics for the “ science ” mob on the left .\nIf you tax something , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , you get more of it .\nPundit Larry Elder lays it out for the reality-resistant : Now let ’ s see , where did this Administration put that Occam ’ s Razor when they needed it ?\nMarc Thiessen startlingly specifies “ a recent paper estimates that 48 percent of workers still make more from unemployment benefits than they would from working.\n” Got that ?\nClosing in on half of those who ought to be laboring are finding themselves better off waiting for their D.C- and state legislature-provided bail-out checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t stop with mere dollars : I lately heard a guy unembarrassedly chatting about the thousands of dollars he ’ s been receiving every month since this grand , tax-payer fueled giveaway began .\nTo be clear , he ’ s collecting this scratch for doing nothing .\nIn a Brobdingnagian case of understatement , regarding the money bonanza that ’ s been fire-hosed into his bank account since coronavirus lockdowns began , he blandly remarked , “ That helps ” .\nConspicuous bottom line ?\nThe chap ’ s in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the Washington Post reports a Department of Labor spokesperson agreeing with President Biden , avowing his shop “ has not seen evidence ” that the government monies incentivize indolence .\nNo evidence , I suppose , other than centuries of consistent human experience , history and unforgiving real-world logic : Enable people to forswear employment — literally reward them for it — and they ’ ll settle into that unproductive path ; for as long as they can .\nFinally , there ’ s these penetratingly timely pearls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : “ The person who labors , labors for himself , for his hungry mouth drives him on.\n” ( Proverbs 16:26 ) “ All the labor of man is for his mouth … ” .\n( Eccl 6:7 ) Pile on the government bread and cheese , so to speak , at no cost , to all comers ?\nThey ’ ll be glad to kick back and take advantage of it — while enjoying their federal and state treasuries-funded vacation .\nIt ’ s beyond unnerving how quickly folks across this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enervating situation ; to the “ government-will-take-care-of-me ” mentality that has locked in , especially among younger people .\nIt ’ s lethal for the public fisc and just as putrefyingly bad for the soul of Americans who were formerly reputed to be hard-workin ’ , can-do types ; not gim me - gim me ’ s with their hands outstretched for the next freebie .\nSloth– among the most infamous of “ deadly sins ” — has been long condemned .\nGovernment ’ s encouraging it via short-sighted , politically driven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it isn ’ t doing so ?\nA wise society will direct some spirited condemnation that-a-way as well .",

         "Cancel work: The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that work is not a virtue. Several years ago , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released an overview of the Green New Deal that mentioned guaranteeing `` economic security '' for people who are `` unable or unwilling to work . ''\nWhen conservative critics noticed those last three words , they pounced .\nFox News waxed poetic about the `` dignity of work '' and Breitbart sneered at the `` self-described Democratic Socialist '' whose `` radical proposal '' ignored that even `` traditional American liberalism regarded full employment as its goal because of the importance of work to society and the individual . ''\nIndeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one 's survival is tied to work — and , thus , those who do n't work do n't deserve to survive , or at least to not be poor .\nYou can see this in the New Testament , where it is written that `` if a man will not work , he shall not eat '' and people are urged to `` settle down and earn the bread they eat . ''\nOver time conservatives found ways of couching that belief in lofty rhetoric about the wonders of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees economic rights to all , somehow we 'll lose our most cherished freedoms .\nEven Democrats have bought into this , most notably when Bill Clinton 's 1996 welfare reform bill threw millions of people off relief by limiting benefits and establishing as a policy priority that recipients eventually be forcibly transitioned back to work .\nFlash forward two years , and one global pandemic , later .\nJoe Biden just passed a historic $ 1.9 trillion stimulus bill to help the millions who are financially struggling as COVID-19 lockdowns spur job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from burnout , stress and exhaustion as their employment lives and domestic lives have involuntarily meshed while they work from home .\nWe do n't need studies to demonstrate how traumatizing this has been : Most of us are either stressed about making ends meet or stressed because the need to work for a living in these unusual times is physically and spiritually taxing .\nYet the people who decide what ideas fall within the Overton window — or the spectrum of opinions deemed socially acceptable — only permit us to seek ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reevaluate it .\nEven in the earliest days of the pandemic , right-wing commentators like Glenn Beck were urging older Americans to risk their lives by going to work lest the economy suffer as authorities tried to contain a deadly disease .\nBillionaires became vastly wealthier during the pandemic while income inequality ( which was already out of control ) significantly worsened .\nBut instead of questioning whether this redistribution of wealth was just or efficient , the political focus has been on `` getting people back to work '' no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home and not work until the pandemic is over ( which countries like the United Kingdom and Spain did to varying degrees ) were never seriously considered — even though scientifically this would have been the most effective way to contain the disease .\nAfter all , if we did that , then people might start to question whether they should be forced to work to survive in the first place .\nAnd we ca n't have that because , well ... reasons .\nBut what are those reasons , exactly ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy crashes — whether in the Great Depression of 1929 , the Great Recession of 2008 or now the Great Lockdowns of 2020 — the most we can hope for is that a moderate liberal like Franklin Roosevelt or Barack Obama will step in and mildly mitigate the damage ?\nWhy do we take it for granted that people must , absolutely must , be forced to work in order to survive ?\nWhy do we insist that anyone who even considers challenging that notion is a lazy and immoral mooch , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — even though , ironically , many of the world 's wealthiest heir and heiresses do no work themselves ?\nWhat if there is a third way of looking at the concept of work , but we are so conditioned to reflexively believe that you must `` earn your living '' that we are failing to recognize it ?\nOcasio-Cortez was not the first political thinker to ponder these things .\nIn his 1932 essay `` In Praise of Idleness , '' philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that there are two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of matter at or near the earth 's surface relatively to other such matter ; second , telling other people to do so . ''\nIn other words , all work is either manual labor or managing manual labor .\nAs Russell quipped : `` The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid ; the second is pleasant and highly paid . ''\nAlthough the first type of work , manual labor , is necessary to some degree , Russell says that it `` is emphatically not one of the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to significantly reduce the amount of labor necessary to provide everyone with their necessities .\nArguing that all human beings should still have to spend most of their days working , even though such work is unnecessary for society and often cruel to the individual , is irrational and immoral .\nYet society has refused to recognize this in part because of the stubbornly persistent belief that work is , in its own right , some kind of reward .\nThat belief , not coincidentally , also allows a small fragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the vast majority wastes most of its year in pointless toil .\nPeople buy into the pro-work ideology even though the moments people most cherish in their lives are usually those tied to pursuits that they choose on their own — whether they make money doing them or not — rather than because of tasks they are forced to perform in order to sustain life .\nIt is n't easy to figure out how to transition away from these assumptions .\nRussell suggested that `` if the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody , and no unemployment — assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization . ''\nThis did not mean that people should be encouraged to fritter away the remaining 20 hours of their work days , but rather that they should use their own judgment on how to create the best quality of life for themselves and other people .\n`` Four hours ' work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life , and that the rest of his time should be his to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Russell posited .\nBarring that , we will continue to inhabit a world in which most of the population is miserably chugging away at pointless , menial jobs because they wrongly believe that misery is essential to survival .\nAs this happens , our culture marinates in the toxic assumption `` that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else , and never for its own sake . ''\nRussell was not the only great thinker to arrive at this type of conclusion .\nIn his 1880 essay `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised in 1883 ) , the Marxist writer Paul Lafargue ( who was also Karl Marx 's son-in-law ) drew back on ancient philosophers from Greece and Rome to argue that free time , not constant work , allows us to realize our optimal selves .\nLafargue believed that we flourish as human beings when we are free to think , to explore , to play , to indulge in our curiosities , to engage in stimulating conversations ... and to decide for ourselves how we can best improve the world we inhabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody on Christian ethics , strikes with its anathema the flesh of the laborer , '' Lafargue wrote .\n`` Its ideal is to reduce the producer to the smallest number of needs , to suppress his joys and his passions and to condemn him to play the part of a machine turning out work without respite and without thanks . ''\nHe pointed out that it is inherently hypocritical for any ethical system to claim to value freedom and then consign people to spend most of their waking hours engaged in dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation ( something even Roosevelt acknowledged ) , a right to free time ... a right , in short , to be lazy .\n`` The unbridled work to which it has given itself up for the last hundred years is the most terrible scourge that has ever struck humanity , '' Lafargue concluded , hoping that one day `` work will become a mere condiment to the pleasures of idleness , a beneficial exercise to the human organism , a passion useful to the social organism only when wisely regulated and limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . ''\nAuthor Mark Twain — best known for writing `` The Adventures of Tom Sawyer '' and `` The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn '' — perhaps most succinctly summed up this point when he told a reporter in 1905 that he had never `` worked '' a day in his life .\n`` What I have done I have done , because it has been play .\nIf it had been work I should n't have done it , '' Twain mused .\nThe beauty is that , when a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended to do , they wind up making the world a better place .\nCertainly they contribute more to society than if they are forced to sacrifice their hours to `` bullshit jobs , '' a term that the late anthropologist David Graeber coined to refer to a special class of meaningless toil in an eponymous 2018 book .\nFour years before writing that book , Graeber told Salon that he was envisioning `` a labor movement that manages to finally ditch all traces of the ideology that says that work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redefines labor as caring for other people . ''\nThroughout his writings , Graeber found evidence that most people will naturally want to help others in order to keep society running .\nThey do not need to be forced to work in order to survive for that to happen .\nIn fact , society winds up wasting its potential for efficiency by requiring people to do that .\nWe create jobs that do not need to exist , or exist solely to help extremely wealthy people engage in lives of leisure , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed to Salon back in 2014 that he was struck by how people who expressed support for the Occupy movement online ( because they were too busy working to do so in person ) made it clear that they wanted fulfilling jobs , not work for its own sake .\n`` The complaints were surprisingly uniform , '' Graeber recalled .\n`` Basically they were all saying , ' I want to do something with my life that actually benefits others ; but if I go into a line of work where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so little , and they put so much in debt , that I ca n't even take care of my own family !\nThis is ridiculous ! '\n'' This brings us back to Ocasio-Cortez and her `` controversial '' idea that people who are unwilling to work should n't be left to die .\nOnly a few weeks after she posted that , Ocasio-Cortez indirectly returned to that belief when an audience member at SXSW asked her about whether automation would ruin lives by putting people out of work .\n`` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specter of being automated out of work , '' Ocasio-Cortez explained .\n`` We should be excited by that .\nBut the reason we 're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you do n't have a job , you are left to die .\nAnd that is , at its core , our problem . ''\nThe good news is that this problem — of meaningless work and too much work — is n't unsolvable .\nWhat Lafargue and Russell observed in the late 19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true today : We have the resources to create a world in which people work for fewer hours and have more free time .\nWe could put a cap on how much wealth any individual or institution could accumulate , establish a universal basic income so that no one would live in poverty and have a strong centralized government to address existential crises like climate change , pandemics and chemical pollution ( an issue that gets overlooked : how plastics and other common products are making us infertile ) .\nThat path seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 've been conditioned to believe that work is an absolute virtue and eliminating major class differences is unthinkable .\nYet the truly radical proposition is that the vast majority of humanity should waste their lives working when they do not have to , just so a small fragment can indulge in excessive leisure because they are extremely wealthy .\nIt is even more radical yet to claim that this should continue happening until , because the wealthy fail to address issues like climate change , they wind up destroying humanity altogether @",

         "Is America experiencing mass psychosis?. In 2020 , 34 percent of Republicans and independents who lean to the right surveyed by Pew Research Center agreed that it was `` probably '' or `` definitely true '' that powerful people intentionally planned the COVID-19 outbreak .\nEighteen percent of Democrats and left-leaners agreed , too .\nThat same year , results from a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey found that approximately three-quarters of Republicans did not trust the 2020 presidential election results .\nIt should go without saying that these kinds of beliefs are fantasy , not rooted in any rational fact or evidence .\nHence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiratorial beliefs and pseudoscience might characterize a vast swath of the American public as delusional .\nFrom the COVID-truther movement to people believing the 2020 presidential election was rigged , it appears that the body politic is — to put it mildly — no longer on the same page .\nGiven the perturbed psychological state of so many Americans , it is worth asking if something is happening — psychologically speaking — that is causing many Americans to live in very different realities .\nPsychologists say yes ; and , moreover , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung .\nIndeed , Jung once wrote that the demise of society would n't be a physical threat , but instead mass delusion — a collective psychosis of sorts .\n`` Carl Jung noted that 'the wolf inside ' man was far more a threat to human existence than external forces , '' Dr. Carla Marie Manly , a clinical psychologist and author of `` Joy From Fear , '' told Salon .\n`` When mental forces become so toxic as to harm our overall well-being on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' can result . ''\nIndeed , Jung himself warned that modern society was prone to collapse due to a pandemic of `` delusional ideas . ''\n`` Greater than all physical dangers are the tremendous effects of delusional ideas , which are yet denied all reality by our world-blinded consciousness , '' Jung wrote .\n`` Our much vaunted reason and our boundlessly overestimated will are sometimes utterly powerless in the face of 'unreal ' thoughts . ''\nNotably , Jung believed that the United States was particularly prone to society-breaking delusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned and tested with caution , for it may very easily turn out to be only a new disease ; that is why true progress is impossible without mature judgment , '' Jung wrote .\n`` The man who is unconscious of the historical context and lets slip his link with the past is in constant danger of succumbing to the crazes and delusions engendered by all novelties . ''\nSome psychologists believe that this is what the country is experiencing right now — more or less .\n`` Something 's definitely happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a painful point , you could say , '' Katharine Bainbridge , a Jungian analyst , tells Salon .\nBut there are caveats .\n`` It 's complicated , '' Bainbridge said .\n`` From the left 's point of view , people that are n't being vaccinated or think the election was rigged are psychotic , right ?\nIf you 're on the right , you think the left is psychotic and has lost its mind in identity politics .\nBoth sides look at each other and say , 'you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsurprisingly , the concept of a `` mass psychosis '' has been seized upon by conspiracy theorists as a rationale for their conspiracies .\nFor instance , anti-vaccination influencers like Joseph Mercola employ the term to suggest that those who are getting vaccinated are the real `` delusional '' ones .\nBainbridge said in order to contextualize what 's actually happening in America through a Jungian lens , one must consider the role of a central guiding myth .\n`` Jung said man can not live without religion — so you make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't not have a central myth to live by .\nHe would say maybe in this time that we 've lost that — we do n't have a collective unifying principle . ''\nCultural theorists often describe the history of human civilization as one of a transition between different central guiding myths .\nIn the Western world , Christianity undergirded everyday existence and society for over a thousand years .\nAfter the Renaissance , the central guiding myth became a belief in rationalism ; then , in modernity , a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all humans .\nThough the phrase is often reviled , the postmodern era — which , roughly , began in the 1960s or 1970s depending on who you ask — merely means the cultural transition into an epoch into which there were no longer any fundamental guiding myths that unified human societies and drove progress .\nSuch an era is , by its nature , more fractured socially ; two humans plucked at random from a postmodern epoch might find themselves believing wildly different things about human society , progress and morality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bainbridge explained , that people needed myths to live by — hence the importance of religion .\nYet interestingly , there has been an ever-increasing number of Americans leaving organized religion .\nIn return , many people — perhaps those who were never religious in the first place — have turned to New Age spiritual beliefs , which in some circles have curiously syncretized with the tenets of the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon .\nBainbridge noted the contrast between New Age circles and QAnon in Jungian terms .\n`` One is super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopian , '' Bainbridge said .\n`` The problem with New Age thinking that is it leaves out the shadow — and then QAnon is obsessed with the shadow . ''\n`` Unfortunately , many people were gravitating toward conspiracy theories prior to the pandemic , '' Manly observed , `` yet this trend has intensified during the pandemic due to surges in online time , anxiety , and feelings of helpless . ''\nManly connected this to Jung 's `` wolf within '' idea .\n`` Individuals and groups who perpetuate conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside ' masses of people — often with substantial negative mental health effects . ''\nBut why is this happening now ?\nAs Bainbridge noted , the coronavirus pandemic appears to have amplified existing rifts .\nJoe Kelly , a cult intervention specialist , also told Salon that humans are often drawn to extremism when they are suffering .\n`` If an individual is hurting — financially , on any level , losing a job , having trouble with their mortgage , having trouble feeding themselves — then they 're more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conspiracy around them that is beyond their control , '' Kelly said .\nSocial psychologists like Jung often see the government as a stand-in for authority figures like parents .\nIndeed , Bainbridge said , one might analogize the draw to conspiracy theories and New Age religions as children acting out when their `` parents '' ( meaning , the state ) are not taking care of them properly .\n`` If the parent is n't taking care of a child , then the child acts out , right ?\nThe child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its needs met , '' Bainbridge said .\n`` And there are lots of people , like left-progressives , who asked : 'How did Trump get elected ? '\nBut once you really look into it , you 're like , that was obvious because there 's a huge part of America that 's in between New York and LA , and those people are fed up and they feel forgotten . ''\nBainbridge says the way out of this conundrum , from a Jungian perspective , is to embrace humanism and empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , and [ ask ] , 'what does it mean to be a human being ? '\n'' Bainbridge said .\n`` It means that you have to integrate your own darkness , wrestle with your own paradoxes and stop projecting out onto other people the opposite inside of you . ''\nBainbridge added : `` There are no simple answers .\nBut we have to hold on to our own humanity , instead of projecting out and demonizing other people .\nThat 's how we survive . ''",

         "More nations halt use of AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine citing clots. London — Sweden on Tuesday became the latest to join a growing list of countries to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine .\nMore than a dozen nations , most of them in Europe , have temporarily halted use of the vaccine as a precautionary measure after a small number of people developed blood clots after getting the shot .\nBut experts in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe are calling it a disaster for the continent 's already-delayed vaccine roll-out .\nCOVID-19 infections are spreading exponentially again in some parts of Europe , even prompting new nationwide lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist there is no link between the Oxford University-developed vaccine and a higher incidence of blood clots .\nThe Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company that teamed up with the prestigious university to produce the drug has said that a review of 17 million people in the U.K. and Europe who 've received the vaccine found that fewer than 40 developed blood clots — `` even lower than you 'd expect to find in the general population , '' AstraZeneca said .\nThe incidence of clotting is similar to that seen with all vaccines , CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pfizer formulas currently being used in the U.S. Denmark , Iceland and Norway were among the first to halt use of the Oxford University-developed vaccine on March 11 .\nThe following day , Thailand abruptly slammed the brakes on the vaccine just before it was set to be rolled out .\nThat decision was reversed on Tuesday as the Thai Prime Minister got his first dose of the vaccine and urged his fellow Thais to do the same .\nBulgaria , Ireland , the Netherlands , Germany , France and Spain have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine , with some saying they would wait at least until the European Medicines Agency — the EU 's pharmaceutical regulator — issues new guidance on the vaccine it approved weeks ago .\nThe agency 's expert panel was gathering Tuesday to review data on clots .\nEstonia , Lithuania , Latvia and Luxembourg have all suspended use of at least one batch of AstraZeneca vaccines delivered to various nations .\nThe drug 's maker has been adamant that there 's no data to suggest any link between its vaccine and any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities have backed up that stance .\nThe European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization both said last week that there was no evidence the drug is causing clots .\n`` An analysis of our safety data of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in any defined age group , gender , batch or in any particular country , '' an AstraZeneca spokesman said .\n`` In fact , the observed number of these types of events are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be expected among the general population . ''\nOfficials from the European Medicines Agency stressed last week that `` there is currently no indication that vaccination causes these conditions , '' and `` the vaccine 's benefits continue to outweigh its risks and the vaccine can continue to be administered . ''\nOn Monday , however , German officials said the pan-EU agency was expected to decide later in the week `` whether and how the new information will affect the authorization of the vaccine . ''\nBritain 's pharmaceuticals regulator issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been widely used for weeks across the U.K. Dr. Phil Bryan , head of vaccine safety for the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) , said people `` should still go and get their COVID-19 vaccine when asked to do so .

         "More states allow COVID vaccine boosters for all adults. Health authorities in several more states said this week that they would broaden eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to all adults , as a growing list of officials look for ways to accelerate third doses in hopes of heading off a potential new wave of the virus .\n`` For Pfizer and Moderna , those who are 18 and over , go get the shot .\nThere 's not any limitations on that .\nObviously you should be six months after the second shot .\nBut we want you to get the booster , '' Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy Beshear and Kansas Governor Laura Kelly made similar announcements on Wednesday .\n`` Expanding access to booster shots will help us put an end to this deadly pandemic , '' Kelly said in a statement .\nThe FDA could act this week to expand eligibility to all adults , but for now these state policies go beyond the recommendations of federal health officials .\nWhile boosters are currently recommended for all adult recipients of Johnson & Johnson 's vaccine , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allows boosters for more limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors 65 and older , adults with underlying medical conditions , and those who live or work in `` high-risk settings . ''\nThe average pace of booster shots has slowed nationwide for weeks , and so far , just 16.5 % of fully vaccinated adults have received a booster , according to the CDC .\nAmong seniors , only two states — Vermont and Minnesota — have recorded a booster dose in more than half of their vaccinated adults 65 and older .\n`` It should be a much simpler process .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and accessible for everyone to get their booster shot with the minimum burden and confusion , '' said Hutchinson .\nOfficials in Arkansas said they had informed the Biden administration of their plans .\nFederal authorities have been mulling whether to expand eligibility for booster shots nationwide , though officials have cautioned that a formal authorization and recommendation could still be weeks away as regulators weigh the risks of rare side effects linked to the shots .\n`` You 're balancing those two things and making sure that everybody has a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said last week , in an interview with WebMD .\nThe latest announcements follow two states that last week declared all of their state 's adult residents eligible for booster shots , ahead of the federal sign-off .\nColorado and New Mexico said their entire states are `` high risk '' enough to need third doses , pointing to federal guidance which currently allows for adults `` who work or live in high-risk settings '' to receive booster shots six months after they were first vaccinated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially said that this recommendation for Pfizer and Moderna boosters was intended for occupations at `` increased risk of being exposed to the virus , '' like first responders or teachers , or congregate settings like prisons and homeless shelters where the agency has recently tracked surges of breakthrough infections .\nBut a state health official confirmed to CBS News that Colorado informally consulted with the CDC to greenlight its plan to expand eligibility for all adults .\n`` I 've been very frustrated with the convoluted messaging out of the CDC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster after six months .\nThe data is incredibly clear that it increases your personal protection level .\nThat 's why my parents got it .\nI got it .\nMy family members got it , '' Colorado Governor Jared Polis told `` Face the Nation '' on Sunday .\nA CDC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment specifically on the move , saying only that providers `` should administer vaccine in accordance '' with the current FDA emergency use authorization and CDC provider agreement .\nAsked about the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doling out booster shots to all adults , authorities in New Mexico said their move `` trumps CDC guidance '' for providers in the state .\n`` Vaccinators are protected , '' said Matt Bieber , a spokesperson for New Mexico 's Department of Health .\nOther jurisdictions have also looked for different avenues to broaden access to booster shots , with New York City announcing on Monday that it was ordering providers not to turn away any adults looking for booster shots .\nWhile providers are generally allowed to prescribe medicines `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the FDA on the private market , the CDC has previously warned vaccine providers that they could face penalties , lose pandemic liability protections , and may not be reimbursed for shots if they defied the agency 's recommendations governing use of the government-purchased COVID-19 vaccine .\nHowever , the CDC has also long urged jurisdictions to remove hurdles for vaccinations , allowing adults to `` self-attest '' whether they were eligible .\nGovernors in West Virginia and New Jersey on Monday also urged adult residents to get booster shots , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for the third doses .\nUltimately New York City 's order , like California 's guidance last week , may amount to codifying a vaccination policy that had been relying largely on the honor system .\n`` The state 's guidance on boosters is in alignment with the CDC .\nIt is simplified to help empower more Californians to get a booster .\nCalifornia has asked vaccine providers to not turn anyone away who has made the self-determination that they need a booster , '' said a spokesperson for California 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster shot ?\nThe renewed push for booster shots comes as some of the Biden administration 's top doctors have redoubled calls for the third doses , ahead of FDA and CDC decisions on whether to expand eligibility nationwide for all adults .\n`` Boosting is going to be an absolutely essential component of our response .\nNot a bonus , not a luxury , but an absolute essential part of the program , '' Dr. Anthony Fauci , the president 's chief medical adviser , told The New York Times last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vaccine advisers rejected Pfizer 's initial request to license booster shots for all American adults earlier this year , a growing body of evidence has continued to suggest protection from the vaccines is waning , even as rates of cases and deaths remain far higher among the unvaccinated .\nOne recent study examining records from the Veterans Health Administration , published earlier this month in Science , found that as the Delta variant surged , effectiveness against symptomatic infections dropped to 58 % with Moderna 's vaccine and 43.3 % with Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at preventing deaths .\nA recent CDC analysis published in JAMA found more vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 hospitalizations among Pfizer than Moderna recipients .\nThe risk of hospitalization appeared to climb after four months for Pfizer recipients , the authors said , a sign of potential `` waning of protection over time , including for severe COVID-19 '' from the shots .\nIn the United Kingdom , health officials said Monday their booster program targeting adults 50 and older saw 87.4 % vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease after a third shot of Pfizer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Canada , health authorities greenlighted booster doses for all adults this month for Moderna and Pfizer .\n`` It is clear , however , that revaccination will be necessary , for the same reasons that influenza revaccination is necessary : antigenic variation and waning immunity , '' Dr. Arnold Monto , who has chaired recent meetings of the FDA 's outside vaccine advisers , concluded in The New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month .\nSo far only Pfizer has formally submitted a renewed request to expand their emergency use authorization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster shot , citing new data from their trials suggesting a booster `` demonstrated a relative vaccine efficacy of 95 % , '' compared to those who did not get a third dose .\nThe FDA 's advisers had previously balked at Pfizer 's initial request to license booster shots for all adults because of concerns over the risks of myocarditis — a rare type of heart inflammation linked to the shots in mostly younger , male recipients .\nTo assuage concerns over myocarditis , Biden administration officials have pointed to data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to roll out Pfizer 's third doses nationwide .\n`` One of the concerns was , if you gave everyone across the age spectrum boosters , would you have a lot more myocarditis , which was a worry after the second dose ? ''\nDr. Peter Marks , the FDA 's top vaccines official , told a recent webinar hosted by the Health Resources & Services Administration .\n`` It is present after the second dose in the Israeli data here , but it does n't seem to be as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe because of the longer period , '' said Marks .",

         "COVID-19 is surging in Arizona schools, but parents are left in the dark. As COVID-19 infections surge in Arizona schools , sickening thousands of students and staff and forcing thousands more into quarantine , parents — and the public at large — have been left without a comprehensive picture of where Arizona students and educators are contracting the virus .\nA patchwork of outbreak and quarantine notifications from school districts has sown confusion among families about the scope of on-campus exposure .\nAnd while districts report infection data to county health officials , who in turn submit it to the state , that information is seldom relayed back to the public in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis has found .\nJust 30 % of Arizona ’ s 215 traditional school districts provide public-facing dashboards that track outbreaks by school , according to AZCIR ’ s review of their websites .\nOf the state ’ s 15 county health departments , only Pima County publicly monitors active COVID-19 cases by district .\nThe state , meanwhile , does not specifically show where school- and day care-based outbreaks are occurring .\nIt offers only county-level totals and a running tally of infections among Arizonans 19 and under .\nThe lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting Arizona schools comes at a time when the rate of COVID-19 transmission among children is poised to surpass that of older age groups for the first time , research conducted by the University of Arizona ’ s Dr. Joe Gerald shows .\nThough severe infections are less common among children than adults , they do happen , as do pediatric deaths from COVID-19 .\nAnd in a state that recently topped 1 million cumulative cases , medical experts said the consequences of school-based outbreaks aren ’ t limited to kids .\nSending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements , school-based testing or high overall vaccination rates has the potential to accelerate COVID transmission statewide , according to Gerald , who oversees UA ’ s public health policy and management program .\nArizonans under 15 now represent about 25 % of COVID-19 cases , up from 10 % during the winter 2020 spike , his analysis of state data shows .\nThe overall percentage of Arizonans testing positive for the virus also continues to climb .\n“ With continued K–12 in-person instruction , plus opening of our major universities , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and young adults ” in the coming weeks , Gerald wrote .\n“ If transmission in these groups spill over , then another surge of cases and hospitalizations similar to that of the summer of 2020 remains possible.\n” Dr. Chris Beyrer , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , said having a “ more systematic , ” more transparent strategy for preventing and tracking school-based cases would go a long way toward curbing the spread of the virus .\n“ What we have is a patchwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies and practices , ” Beyrer said .\n“ While local nuances are important , there ’ s nothing like rational statewide and national planning to get this right .\nAnd we ’ re just not there.\n” Frustrated parents turn to each other A 2020 emergency measure from the Department of Health Services requires Arizona schools and child care establishments to report COVID-19 outbreaks to local county health departments within 24 hours .\nCounty officials must share the information with the state using Arizona ’ s Medical Electronic Disease Surveillance Intelligence System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not required by law to post it online .\nMost don ’ t , with the exception of Pima and Maricopa counties .\nPima alone pinpoints where outbreaks are occurring ; Maricopa County reports only numbers of active and resolved school outbreaks .\nIn counties without comprehensive school-outbreak dashboards , the decision to publicize school-level case and quarantine data is left to individual districts .\nThe Arizona Department of Education said in a statement that it “ has urged all public schools to communicate transparently about school-related outbreaks with staff , students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .\n“ Now , as cases , particularly in children , are rapidly increasing , families need the best information possible to stay safe and slow the spread of the virus , ” ADE spokesperson Morgan Dick wrote in an email .\n“ ADE recognizes this can be incredibly challenging for some school communities , given limited resources and capacity .\nNevertheless , robust , transparent communication is vital to keeping our schools safe and healthy , and ultimately able to operate and provide in-person instruction.\n” While school officials don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases or exposures , they do have to alert parents if their child was in close contact with a known COVID-19 case , typically via email or letters sent home .\nAs of late August , some schools were sending home advisories daily or almost daily .\nThe nearly 150 advisories submitted to AZCIR ’ s school-based outbreak tracker in August indicate the level of detail provided in school notifications varies .\nSome letters tell parents that their child could have been in contact with someone on campus who “ may ” have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others confirm numbers of new cases and specify the last day a COVID-positive student or staffer was at school .\nThe resulting confusion is palpable on social media platforms , where parents have flocked in an attempt to piece together how the virus is hitting their kids ’ classrooms , bus routes and after-school programs .\nMany have uploaded alerts from schools or reported outbreaks , seeking to compare notes .\n“ There is a covid outbreak at Franklin Elementary East campus , ” one Mesa Public Schools parent posted on Twitter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mpsaz elementary schools are experiencing outbreaks ?\n” A few days later , a BASIS Charter Schools parent posted that parents in that school system “ are sharing covid+ case announcement emails with each other , since our schools only update trackers 1/week.\n” “ Every single day the past 1.5 weeks has been stressful , ” she wrote .\nSome families have formed private Facebook groups to jointly track outbreaks and exposures as they navigate an uncertain school year .\nOthers are logging numbers on their own .\nQueen Creek dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler Unified School District data to calculate that about 2 % of the student and staff population at his sons ’ high school , Casteel , had been infected with COVID-19 during the first month of school .\nHe said he suspects the total is higher given the number of students not in class .\nLike many other school districts , Chandler Unified does not isolate new cases on its daily dashboard , listing only “ active ” and “ resolved ” counts , nor does it quantify the number of students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus .\nThe district also erases past dashboard entries , which makes it difficult to track patterns over time , according to Flowers .\n“ You can get to the information , but it ’ s not being honest with people , ” Flowers said .\n“ I mean , you should be able to see every day how many new cases are showing up in your school , how many new cases are showing up in the district.\n” Chandler Unified spokesman Terry Locke said the primary goal of the dashboard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a school is approaching thresholds that may lead to additional mitigation , ” and officials “ update the number of active cases daily to allow the public to review trends.\n” “ We are limited in manpower to compile additional data , so compiling quarantine numbers ( is ) not feasible , ” he wrote in an email .\nEpidemiologist : Those under 12 at heightened risk Frustration over the lack of comprehensive outbreak information comes on top of ongoing tensions related to a law signed by Republican Gov .\nDoug Ducey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring masks .\nThough the law doesn ’ t take effect until Sept. 29 — assuming a pending lawsuit seeking to block it does not succeed — the majority of school districts in the state have opted not to mandate face coverings .\nMore than 30 districts and several higher education institutions have , though some have broad opt-out policies .\nBeyrer , the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist , argued inconsistent mask coverage has left Arizona students of all age groups unnecessarily vulnerable to infection upon returning to classrooms .\nThose under age 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are at particular risk , he said , with “ an increasing number of kids of this age in the hospital.\n” Among August COVID-19 hospitalizations in Maricopa County , about 6 % were children , with kids under 12 representing one in six COVID cases overall , according to county health officials .\nBefore the school year began , children constituted about 3 % of Maricopa County ’ s COVID hospitalizations .\nWhile those 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine , vaccination rates among that population remain low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more autonomous and more social , mixing in different ways than children do , which makes them “ more important in community spread , ” Beyrer said .\nAnd kids of any age can get so-called long haul COVID-19—where symptoms such as fatigue , headaches , dizziness and shortness of breath can persist indefinitely—even if they have a relatively mild case , Beyrer said .\n“ We ’ re not really sure how to treat that in children , ” he said .\nThis story was published by Arizona Center for @ @

As sad as it may be , children get abducted , and it happens more often than you might think .\nMoreover , the “ bad guy ” isn ’ t always a guy , and they don ’ t always look threatening — it could even be someone you know .\nSo it ’ s important to take precautions and teach your kids who they can trust and what they should do if someone wants to take them somewhere without your knowledge .\nWe at Bright Side hope nothing like this ever happens to you or your children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n1 .\nDanger doesn ’ t always come from a stranger .\nIt may be hard for a child to understand who ’ s a stranger and who they can trust .\nThey might imagine someone scary-looking , but that ’ s not always what a person who could hurt them looks like .\n“ Strangers ” can also appear nice and friendly .\nIn fact , it ’ s more often the case that children are abducted by someone they actually know and wouldn ’ t consider a stranger .\n2.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult Make a list of people your child can trust — people that can pick them up from school or come by your house even if your kid is home alone .\nIt could be a relative , a neighbor that you know well , or a babysitter .\nTell your child about them , and say that if anyone else comes by or approaches them outside , it ’ s not safe to talk to them .\nYou can even pick a code word that only you , your kid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That way it might be easier for your child to understand who to trust .\n3 .\nRun in the opposite direction of the car .\nTeach your kid that if they are being followed by someone driving a car , they should run in the opposite direction .\nThat way , the car will have to turn around , and your kid will have more time to run away .\n4 .\nLook for a mom with kids .\nIf none of the “ safe people ” from your list are around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to look for a mom with kids and ask for their help .\nThey can also try to find a police officer , but it ’ s more likely that a woman with a child will be easier to find .\n5 .\nLet others know you ’ re in danger .\nChildren often throw tantrums , so a screaming child might not attract attention , even if they ’ re in danger .\nThat ’ s why it can help to tell your kids to scream out something that would alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nI don ’ t know you !\n” or “ Where ’ s my mom and dad ?\nHelp !\n” If screaming isn ’ t enough and they need to attract more attention , the kid can try to be destructive .\nFor example , they could knock things off the shelf if they ’ re in a store , or break a car window with a rock .\n7 .\nHow to say “ no ” Your child should know that it ’ s okay to say “ no ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not their parent or a “ safe ” person .\nIt can be hard for a child to be assertive and oppose an adult , but you should teach them how to do it .\nYou can even play out different scenarios with your child , like , for example , how they will respond if someone approaches them and offers candy or asks for help .\n8 .\nOnline safety is just as important .\nTalk to your child about what they do on the Internet , what apps they use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure they know that being online can be dangerous too and that they should be careful talking to strangers there as well .\nBoth of you can also make sure that people online are actually the same people they are in real life — friends or family members — and not imposters .",

         "Horseshoes and widow's peaks: Why do men go bald in different patterns?. In a 1997 episode of `` Seinfeld , '' a character named Kurt learns to his dismay that he is going bald .\nHis dismay does n't stem from his aversion to being hairless ; in fact , he is a swimmer , and is used to shaving his cranium to better compete .\nBut when he learns that he may become involuntarily bald , he sinks into a state of impulsivity and depression .\nWhile most bald people do not react as poorly as the `` Seinfeld '' swimmer , the episode does accurately capture a basic truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not simply that men are self-conscious , but that male pattern baldness imparts a feeling of disempowerment over their appearance .\n`` Male pattern baldness or Androgenetic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss , affecting up to 80 % of men in their lifetime , '' Dr. Kristen Lo Sicco , an associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Health , told Salon by email .\n`` About 75 % of people with Androgenetic alopecia have at least one family member with this type of hair loss . ''\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery of baldness , and the lack of control over it .\nIt is distressing for any human to feel that one 's body is out of one 's control , that it is doing things without our consent .\nYet science has a sense of why , and how , baldness happens — and why men ( and sometimes women ) lose power over their hair .\nThere is , apparently , a connection between a chemical that we associate with masculinity — testosterone — and the looming threat that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who suffers from male pattern baldness has hair follicles that sensitive to the testosterone metabolite , or dehydrotestosterone .\nLike the color of your eyes or shape of your earlobe , the structure of your hairline is actually quite individual and says a great deal about you .\nUntil recently , scientists did n't have a particularly comprehensive knowledge about different types of hairlines .\nThat 's because early major classification systems tended to mostly or entirely study only one race ( Caucasian men , Japanese men ) .\nIn 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. O'Tar Norwood studied male pattern baldness in over 1,000 males and came up with the system most commonly used today .\nAccording to Norwood 's system , most hair loss begins at the temples and gradually recedes back , eventually leaving a peninsula of hair in the middle of the scalp .\nIf the baldness continues , that peninsula will become more narrow while the hair on the crown starts to thin out .\nIf your baldness insists on defoliating your cranium even further , the peninsula will start to shrink the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown .\nWhen the two areas of baldness finally meet , you will be left with nothing but a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair .\nThere is one variant to this system , which Norwood dubbed `` Type A . ''\nIts main features are that it deprives the early balding man of that precious peninsula but spares him that initial thinning on the crown .\nInstead , like a retreating army destined to be court marshaled for abandoning their position , the hair at the front simply gives up the fight and allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape atop one 's skull .\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox ?\nSubscribe to Salon 's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist .\nAnalogies aside , there are straightforward scientific explanations for why one 's hair seems to abandon you .\nThe truth is that , with male pattern baldness , the hair is n't falling off of your head in unusually large quantities .\n( Hair is supposed to fall out , after all . )\nIt is rather that the hair does n't grow back as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to cause the appearance of balding , '' Lo Sicco explained .\nThe first is called `` miniaturization .\n`` This means the hair shafts are becoming smaller and smaller in caliber ( thickness ) over time , '' Lo Sicco continued .\nThe second is `` shortening of the growth phase of hair , '' known as `` the anagen phase . ''\n`` This means less hair will be on the scalp and will become shorter , '' Lo Sicco said .\n`` This is because the length of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anagen phase . ''\nThe type of hairline that you wind up with depends on how your biological chemistry impacts the hair follicles at different locations on your head .\nLikewise , it turns out there is also a reason that bald men continue growing hair on the back and sides of their head — the `` horseshoe '' pattern of hair , as sported by celebrities like Larry David and the late James Gandolfini .\n`` The hair on the top and front of the scalp is susceptible to androgens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not ( occipital scalp ) , '' Lo Sicco wrote .\n`` This theory is known as 'donor dominance , ' pioneered by Dr. Orentreich who developed hair transplantation in the US while at the NYU Skin & Cancer Unit . ''\nWhile it is easy to joke about male pattern baldness , it is not a harmless medical condition .\nDepending on the stage and severity , baldness has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease ( although the extent of that risk is still debated ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate cancer .\nThe exact mechanisms are unknown , however , as much still remains to be learned about the exact mechanisms behind baldness .",

Today , more than ever , men are involved in parenting .\nYet , still , fathers are not seen as full-value parents but rather as babysitters who are praised for the basic attention they give to their kids .\nOn the other hand , women ’ s parenting does not get proper credit .\nKeira Knightly , a British actress and mother to 2 daughters , spoke out about why this distorted perspective on parenting negatively affects both fathers and mothers .\nShe has always advocated for equal parenting Keira Knightly has advocated for equal parental responsibilities for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews , Knightly spoke out about the unequal treatment mothers and fathers get from society while contributing to parenting .\nAnswering the ongoing question that working mothers often get , which is , how to balance work and motherhood , Knightly , instead of giving dozens of existing hacks , asked back , “ Why do we not engage men in that conversation ?\nWhy do we not expect a working man to be looking after their children as much as their partner is ?\nWhy do we assume that they don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with their children as well ?\n” Fathers seem to be praised for the minimum effort The times when women had to prioritize childcare over a career have passed .\nMore single women see careers as the main priority in their lives .\nThough , when working mothers do contribute to their children , people still tend to take the mother ’ s parenting for granted — as something normal and self-evident .\nWhile fathers , who are expected to prioritize their careers , are seen spending time with kids and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ It ’ s really rare to see a guy at a children ’ s [ daycare ] , and if he is , people say , ’ Ooh , what a lovely dad .\nLook at him looking after his own children , ’ ” Knightley notes .\n“ You would never say that to a woman.\n” “ We really need to start asking men about what their role within the childcare situation is , how much of that they take on , and expect them to take on that responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect women to take on that responsibility , and yet for some reason , we give men a free pass.\n” Many other mothers also see the issue Knightly ’ s position is shared by many mothers who manage to combine a career with being good mothers .\n“ Men continue to be placed on pedestals after women built those pedestals for them to stand on , ” says Candace Ganger , a mother of 2 .\n“ While I ’ m the parent who has remained at home , caring for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spiritually , their father is praised for simply showing up to see them .\nAll parents should be recognized for their efforts , regardless of the situation , but these different expectations are dangerous and unfair.\n” This perspective diminishes the role of caring fathers as well .\nFathers themselves support the idea that we shouldn ’ t treat their contribution to parenting as something extraordinary .\n“ Dads don ’ t babysit ” is a movement started several years ago that stands for fathers being treated not as babysitters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as full-value parents .\n“ I ’ ve had people ask me , ’ Are you looking after the kids today ?\n’ Or say ’ I can tell you dressed the baby today , ’ ” said Al Ferguson , a dad whose t-shirt caption started the whole “ Dads don ’ t babysit ” conversation .\n“ It ’ s just out of date .\nThe modern dad is more active in their family life than they were historically .\nIt ’ s out of date to assume the mom is @ @ @ @ @",

         "'Unconscionable': Texas energy companies face stark criticism for price-gouging amid emergency. As the in Texas still leaves thousands without power , Texans are reporting that the cost of their utility bills has skyrocketed , with some bills in the thousands for just one week of power .\n`` The average price for electricity in Texas in the winter is about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , '' .\n`` Texas utility regulators allowed that price to rise to $ 9 per kilowatt-hour . ''\nThose most affected by the price hikes are on `` variable-rate power plans , '' which gives energy companies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer demand .\nGenerally , when demand increases , the price does too .\nVariable-rate plans are during periods of low energy usage ( i.e .\nnormal weather conditions ) because customers get to pay at a discounted rate .\nHowever , when the devastating winter storm hit Texas , leaving millions without water and heat , those discounted rates went out the window .\nMany utility companies have already begun the process of damage control .\nLast week , CPS Energy ( `` the nation 's largest municipally-owned gas and electric utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is `` unacceptable to have customers bears the costs on their monthly bill , '' it was `` working diligently to find ways to spread those costs to 10 years or longer to make it more affordable . ''\nWholesale electricity retailer Griddy –– now being by a Chambers County resident for $ 1 billion –– remarkably insisted that its customers switch electricity providers before they might be affected by the price spikes .\nHowever , switching providers can take days , making it too late for customers to skirt around the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Social Security The New York Times that Griddy had charged him $ 16,752 for the month of February .\n`` There 's nothing I can do about it , '' Willoughby said , `` But it 's broken me . ''\nGriddy in a blog post last Thursday , `` We intend to fight this for , and alongside , our customers for equity and accountability – to reveal why such price increases were allowed to happen as millions of Texans went without power , '' On Sunday , the Texas Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnections due to non-payments and discontinue sending monthly estimates to customers .\nHowever , it should be noted that the commission gave the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) –– which oversees the majority of Texas ' power grid –– the go-ahead to increase prices due to a bottleneck in supply .\nTexas Gov .\nGreg Abbot –– who erroneously attributed green energy to the sweeping outages –– has called for an investigation into ERCOT , five of whose board members they would resign on Wednesday .\n`` We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energy bills that are a result of the severe winter weather and power outages , '' Abbot on Saturday during an emergency meeting .\nTexans , however , are demanding that concrete action be taken .\n`` The state government is gon na have to step in and basically hold people harmless—in other words , make sure that those exorbitant costs are not passed onto the customer here , '' said Rep. Joaquin Castro , D-Texas .\n`` And I think they 're gon na see that there 's gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are liberal and conservative and across the political spectrum who are refusing to pay $ 2,000 when for two days they did n't even get power , and they 're not even responsible for the poor planning that went on by state leaders . ''\nOther officials echoed Castro 's concerns , emphasizing that customers should not bear the brunt of the financial cost when so many of them are already in vulnerable positions during the storm .\nSan Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg told CNN on Sunday that `` it would be unconscionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills to be put on the backs of residents of the state that have been suffering and freezing their homes for the last week , through no fault of their own .

Corruption in the United Kingdom is once again in the news .\nConservative Party MPs have been caught with their hands in the till , abusing their positions to pad their bank accounts .\nThe regime of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has attempted a cover-up – trying to use its majority in the lower house to pass laws muzzling the anti-graft watchdog , who in turn has reportedly received death threats .\nNewspaper editorials are decrying “ sleaze ” – a catchall phrase for questionable and scandalous conduct – in the oil-rich kingdom where , since the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest , a third of MPs have pocketed nearly $ 7m in payments for moonlighting with private firms , including those bidding for contracts related to pandemic measures .\nFurther , the ruling party has also been accused of selling seats in the upper chamber of parliament , the House of Lords , to donors for up to $ 4m .\nIt is not the first time the public in the ethnically divided country , which is plagued by tribal separatist movements in the regions of Scotland and Northern Ireland , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a report published by the National Audit Office , just over 1 percent of COVID-19 contracts worth $ 24bn awarded to suppliers between March and July last year , were awarded using a competitive process .\nThe process was shrouded in secrecy , with a local court ruling that the then-health minister , Matt Hancock , had broken the law by failing to publish details of contracts within the required 30 days .\nIn fact , the government introduced a “ high-priority lane ” which gave special treatment to suppliers recommended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the opposition shadow cabinet office minister would describe as “ an unedifying gold rush of chums and chancers ” .\nCorruption in the high echelons of British power has not been reserved to the pandemic era .\nA decade ago , for example , parliamentarians in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords were caught up in a scheme involving widespread abuse of claims for allowances and expenses worth at least $ 2m , for which several were forced to resign and others sent to jail .\nThe pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frequent practice of the ruling elite .\nThe whole country has been identified as an international hub for tax evasion and money laundering as well as a major destination for illicit financial flows from across the globe .\nIt controls a “ spider ’ s web ” of territories and dependencies ( where the British government has full powers to impose or veto lawmaking ) which , according to the Tax Justice Network , “ operates as a global web of tax havens laundering and shifting money into and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top abettor of theft and corruption .\nYet it is interesting that when discussing corruption in the kingdom , where , according to the humanitarian agency FareShare , one in every eight people struggles to afford enough to eat , few ever describe it as a cultural problem in the same way corruption is described when encountered in Africa .\n“ The African is corrupt through and through … They are all corrupt .\nThe fact that over countless centuries the African has been a victim of the worst climate in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault .\nBut he has been sapped mentally and physically .\nWe brought him Western education .\nBut what use is it to him ?\n” says Mr Green , the white senior civil servant in Chinua Achebe ’ s novel , No Longer at Ease .\nWhile many may be averse to openly expressing such sentiment in today ’ s post- # BlackLivesMatter days , a glance at newspaper reports , both on and off the continent , would reveal that the intrinsic corruption of the African is nonetheless a widely held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the post-colonial state : how the west invented African corruption , racism scholar Gabriel Apata notes , that while corruption is universal , “ when it comes to Africa , [ corruption ] has remained a permanent black mark that will not shift , an idea that encapsulates the African predicament in all its various shades and manifestations ” .\nHe shows how media descriptions of it often present it as a form of pathology : “ a cancer , virus , epidemic , cankerworm and so forth , these descriptions evoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV-AIDS whose origins lie in Africa … Nowhere else or about no other continent is corruption described in these terms.\n” This is despite the fact that African scholars have long traced the roots of corruption to colonialism .\nAs Kenyan author Joe Khamisi notes in his book Looters and Grabbers : 54 Years of Corruption and Plunder by the Elite 1963-2017 , the role of colonialism in establishing corruption practices has not stopped attempts to portray them as a legacy of the pre-colonial past – including as a consequence of a wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out gifts to “ chiefs ” who , ironically , are themselves another colonial invention .\nSuch attempts to indigenise graft follow the path of other invented and supposedly “ African ” realities such as the “ tribe ” .\nAs Apata points out , the corruption prototype “ emerged out of Western neo-liberal capitalist tradition and its exploitative tendencies , a system that was exported to Africa and which in turn became Africanised ” .\nIn this sense , the corruption found especially in “ Black Africa ” is presented as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlightened practices of the “ developed ” West .\nSo while they may both have corrupt officials who abuse their power to rip off their citizens , the corrupt European politician is presented as a societal aberration , a negation of its wholesome values , while the corrupt African official is taken as the embodiment of African values .\nThis racialised approach is also reflected in the different language used to describe practices that look very similar .\nMPs in the UK are paid by companies to “ lobby ” for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ high-priority lane ” .\nWhen much the same thing happens in Kenya , MPs are said to have received “ bribes ” and money is “ funnelled ” into the pockets of their corrupt benefactors in the private sector .\nWhen public officials steal money from Africans , their countries quickly earn themselves the unhappy distinction of being “ corrupt ” .\nYet when the same money is hidden , as revealed by the Pandora Papers , in Western tax havens , with the help of Western consultants , firms and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n“ It has caused me the greatest trouble , and forever causes me the greatest trouble , to perceive that unspeakably more depends upon what things are called , than on what they are , ” wrote German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche .\nThis is undoubtedly true of the Western worldview regarding corruption .\nThe attempt to essentialise and exoticise “ African corruption ” only serves to obscure its real roots and to sanitise the same behaviour in the West .\nAnd as Nietzsche went on to note , “ the appearance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence in the end , and operates as the essence ” .\nThe views expressed in this article are the author ’ s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera ’ s editorial stance .",

       "{0: ['Government Paying Americans Not To Work … Biden Insists That’s Not A Problem. I was chatting with my barber the other day and inquired why there ’ d been such a long wait for a spot in the chair that morning .\\nHer reply was unexpectedly mordant — and blunt : Only one person had been available to do the cutting when the shop opened because “ we can ’ t get anyone to work.\\n” “ Don ’ t you know that ’ s a myth ?\\n” I replied ironically .\\nShe smirked and continued clipping away .\\nThese days George Orwell is every conservative ’ s go-to guy for punchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a “ right-winger ” himself — by his own assertion , in fact , a “ democratic socialist ” .\\nThat doesn ’ t mean he ’ d be enamored with the likes of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi .\\nIt ’ s plausible he ’ d be horrified by most contemporary Western liberals .\\nOr Democrats .\\nRecall , Orwell is the celebrated epigrammarian who first said , “ the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.\\n” In this regard , the above Leftists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as “ anti-Orwells ” .\\nThey seem fixated on dismissing , even disguising , the glaringly self-evident about so much ; unemployment numbers included .\\nOf course , for exhibit A I have in mind President Joe Biden .\\nAfter two disappointing monthly job reports in a row — April ’ s downright catastrophically so — he ’ s unshakably assured us there ’ s zilch truth to the charge that millions of unemployed Americans are forgoing an employment search because COVID-19 relief payments are making it more lucrative to remain loitering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s been a lot of discussion … that people are being paid to stay home rather than go to work , ” admitted the Chief Exec .\\nBut then : “ Well , we don ’ t see much evidence of that.\\n” Despite abysmal job-creation stats , Biden scoffed at what he waved off as “ loose talk that Americans just don ’ t want to work.\\n” So , that settles the economic debate , Mr. President ?\\nPoint of fact , anecdotal indicators and a trove of collected data ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) signal there is , indeed , a hiring problem .\\nThis also tracks with common sense : as my father has said , “ Pay people not to work and they won ’ t work.\\n” That truism isn ’ t rendered inoperative just because the “ don ’ t work ” payments are gussied up as “ COVID-relief ” .\\nOr because our forty-sixth president says it ain ’ t so .\\nExperience affirms you generally get more of what you subsidize financially — in this latest case , we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gladly cooperating .\\nThe editors at National Review put it this way in their June 1 edition : “ One thing the government is good at doing is getting more of what it pays for : in this case , idleness.\\n” As with everything in life , there are doubtless exceptions to this pattern , but it does appear to be a genuine , broad and regrettably debilitating phenomenon .\\nApplying some available street smarts to the matter should have predicted all this long ago .\\nWe are seeing the debasement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the economic front .\\n… All the Biden folks needed to do was stop gazing into their cracked crystal ball and go outside and ask business owners if they can find workers .\\n… Instead , the liberals paid attention to some cockamamie econometric model saying you can pay people more not to work and it won ’ t change their behavior .\\nBrilliant .\\n… Here is a simple , ironclad law of economics for the “ science ” mob on the left .\\nIf you tax something , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , you get more of it .\\nPundit Larry Elder lays it out for the reality-resistant : Now let ’ s see , where did this Administration put that Occam ’ s Razor when they needed it ?\\nMarc Thiessen startlingly specifies “ a recent paper estimates that 48 percent of workers still make more from unemployment benefits than they would from working.\\n” Got that ?\\nClosing in on half of those who ought to be laboring are finding themselves better off waiting for their D.C- and state legislature-provided bail-out checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t stop with mere dollars : I lately heard a guy unembarrassedly chatting about the thousands of dollars he ’ s been receiving every month since this grand , tax-payer fueled giveaway began .\\nTo be clear , he ’ s collecting this scratch for doing nothing .\\nIn a Brobdingnagian case of understatement , regarding the money bonanza that ’ s been fire-hosed into his bank account since coronavirus lockdowns began , he blandly remarked , “ That helps ” .\\nConspicuous bottom line ?\\nThe chap ’ s in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the Washington Post reports a Department of Labor spokesperson agreeing with President Biden , avowing his shop “ has not seen evidence ” that the government monies incentivize indolence .\\nNo evidence , I suppose , other than centuries of consistent human experience , history and unforgiving real-world logic : Enable people to forswear employment — literally reward them for it — and they ’ ll settle into that unproductive path ; for as long as they can .\\nFinally , there ’ s these penetratingly timely pearls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : “ The person who labors , labors for himself , for his hungry mouth drives him on.\\n” ( Proverbs 16:26 ) “ All the labor of man is for his mouth … ” .\\n( Eccl 6:7 ) Pile on the government bread and cheese , so to speak , at no cost , to all comers ?\\nThey ’ ll be glad to kick back and take advantage of it — while enjoying their federal and state treasuries-funded vacation .\\nIt ’ s beyond unnerving how quickly folks across this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enervating situation ; to the “ government-will-take-care-of-me ” mentality that has locked in , especially among younger people .\\nIt ’ s lethal for the public fisc and just as putrefyingly bad for the soul of Americans who were formerly reputed to be hard-workin ’ , can-do types ; not gim me - gim me ’ s with their hands outstretched for the next freebie .\\nSloth– among the most infamous of “ deadly sins ” — has been long condemned .\\nGovernment ’ s encouraging it via short-sighted , politically driven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it isn ’ t doing so ?\\nA wise society will direct some spirited condemnation that-a-way as well .',\n",
       "  \"Cancel work: The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that work is not a virtue. Several years ago , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released an overview of the Green New Deal that mentioned guaranteeing `` economic security '' for people who are `` unable or unwilling to work . ''\\nWhen conservative critics noticed those last three words , they pounced .\\nFox News waxed poetic about the `` dignity of work '' and Breitbart sneered at the `` self-described Democratic Socialist '' whose `` radical proposal '' ignored that even `` traditional American liberalism regarded full employment as its goal because of the importance of work to society and the individual . ''\\nIndeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one 's survival is tied to work — and , thus , those who do n't work do n't deserve to survive , or at least to not be poor .\\nYou can see this in the New Testament , where it is written that `` if a man will not work , he shall not eat '' and people are urged to `` settle down and earn the bread they eat . ''\\nOver time conservatives found ways of couching that belief in lofty rhetoric about the wonders of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees economic rights to all , somehow we 'll lose our most cherished freedoms .\\nEven Democrats have bought into this , most notably when Bill Clinton 's 1996 welfare reform bill threw millions of people off relief by limiting benefits and establishing as a policy priority that recipients eventually be forcibly transitioned back to work .\\nFlash forward two years , and one global pandemic , later .\\nJoe Biden just passed a historic $ 1.9 trillion stimulus bill to help the millions who are financially struggling as COVID-19 lockdowns spur job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from burnout , stress and exhaustion as their employment lives and domestic lives have involuntarily meshed while they work from home .\\nWe do n't need studies to demonstrate how traumatizing this has been : Most of us are either stressed about making ends meet or stressed because the need to work for a living in these unusual times is physically and spiritually taxing .\\nYet the people who decide what ideas fall within the Overton window — or the spectrum of opinions deemed socially acceptable — only permit us to seek ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reevaluate it .\\nEven in the earliest days of the pandemic , right-wing commentators like Glenn Beck were urging older Americans to risk their lives by going to work lest the economy suffer as authorities tried to contain a deadly disease .\\nBillionaires became vastly wealthier during the pandemic while income inequality ( which was already out of control ) significantly worsened .\\nBut instead of questioning whether this redistribution of wealth was just or efficient , the political focus has been on `` getting people back to work '' no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home and not work until the pandemic is over ( which countries like the United Kingdom and Spain did to varying degrees ) were never seriously considered — even though scientifically this would have been the most effective way to contain the disease .\\nAfter all , if we did that , then people might start to question whether they should be forced to work to survive in the first place .\\nAnd we ca n't have that because , well ... reasons .\\nBut what are those reasons , exactly ?\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy crashes — whether in the Great Depression of 1929 , the Great Recession of 2008 or now the Great Lockdowns of 2020 — the most we can hope for is that a moderate liberal like Franklin Roosevelt or Barack Obama will step in and mildly mitigate the damage ?\\nWhy do we take it for granted that people must , absolutely must , be forced to work in order to survive ?\\nWhy do we insist that anyone who even considers challenging that notion is a lazy and immoral mooch , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — even though , ironically , many of the world 's wealthiest heir and heiresses do no work themselves ?\\nWhat if there is a third way of looking at the concept of work , but we are so conditioned to reflexively believe that you must `` earn your living '' that we are failing to recognize it ?\\nOcasio-Cortez was not the first political thinker to ponder these things .\\nIn his 1932 essay `` In Praise of Idleness , '' philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that there are two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of matter at or near the earth 's surface relatively to other such matter ; second , telling other people to do so . ''\\nIn other words , all work is either manual labor or managing manual labor .\\nAs Russell quipped : `` The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid ; the second is pleasant and highly paid . ''\\nAlthough the first type of work , manual labor , is necessary to some degree , Russell says that it `` is emphatically not one of the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to significantly reduce the amount of labor necessary to provide everyone with their necessities .\\nArguing that all human beings should still have to spend most of their days working , even though such work is unnecessary for society and often cruel to the individual , is irrational and immoral .\\nYet society has refused to recognize this in part because of the stubbornly persistent belief that work is , in its own right , some kind of reward .\\nThat belief , not coincidentally , also allows a small fragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the vast majority wastes most of its year in pointless toil .\\nPeople buy into the pro-work ideology even though the moments people most cherish in their lives are usually those tied to pursuits that they choose on their own — whether they make money doing them or not — rather than because of tasks they are forced to perform in order to sustain life .\\nIt is n't easy to figure out how to transition away from these assumptions .\\nRussell suggested that `` if the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody , and no unemployment — assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization . ''\\nThis did not mean that people should be encouraged to fritter away the remaining 20 hours of their work days , but rather that they should use their own judgment on how to create the best quality of life for themselves and other people .\\n`` Four hours ' work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life , and that the rest of his time should be his to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Russell posited .\\nBarring that , we will continue to inhabit a world in which most of the population is miserably chugging away at pointless , menial jobs because they wrongly believe that misery is essential to survival .\\nAs this happens , our culture marinates in the toxic assumption `` that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else , and never for its own sake . ''\\nRussell was not the only great thinker to arrive at this type of conclusion .\\nIn his 1880 essay `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised in 1883 ) , the Marxist writer Paul Lafargue ( who was also Karl Marx 's son-in-law ) drew back on ancient philosophers from Greece and Rome to argue that free time , not constant work , allows us to realize our optimal selves .\\nLafargue believed that we flourish as human beings when we are free to think , to explore , to play , to indulge in our curiosities , to engage in stimulating conversations ... and to decide for ourselves how we can best improve the world we inhabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody on Christian ethics , strikes with its anathema the flesh of the laborer , '' Lafargue wrote .\\n`` Its ideal is to reduce the producer to the smallest number of needs , to suppress his joys and his passions and to condemn him to play the part of a machine turning out work without respite and without thanks . ''\\nHe pointed out that it is inherently hypocritical for any ethical system to claim to value freedom and then consign people to spend most of their waking hours engaged in dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation ( something even Roosevelt acknowledged ) , a right to free time ... a right , in short , to be lazy .\\n`` The unbridled work to which it has given itself up for the last hundred years is the most terrible scourge that has ever struck humanity , '' Lafargue concluded , hoping that one day `` work will become a mere condiment to the pleasures of idleness , a beneficial exercise to the human organism , a passion useful to the social organism only when wisely regulated and limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . ''\\nAuthor Mark Twain — best known for writing `` The Adventures of Tom Sawyer '' and `` The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn '' — perhaps most succinctly summed up this point when he told a reporter in 1905 that he had never `` worked '' a day in his life .\\n`` What I have done I have done , because it has been play .\\nIf it had been work I should n't have done it , '' Twain mused .\\nThe beauty is that , when a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended to do , they wind up making the world a better place .\\nCertainly they contribute more to society than if they are forced to sacrifice their hours to `` bullshit jobs , '' a term that the late anthropologist David Graeber coined to refer to a special class of meaningless toil in an eponymous 2018 book .\\nFour years before writing that book , Graeber told Salon that he was envisioning `` a labor movement that manages to finally ditch all traces of the ideology that says that work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redefines labor as caring for other people . ''\\nThroughout his writings , Graeber found evidence that most people will naturally want to help others in order to keep society running .\\nThey do not need to be forced to work in order to survive for that to happen .\\nIn fact , society winds up wasting its potential for efficiency by requiring people to do that .\\nWe create jobs that do not need to exist , or exist solely to help extremely wealthy people engage in lives of leisure , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed to Salon back in 2014 that he was struck by how people who expressed support for the Occupy movement online ( because they were too busy working to do so in person ) made it clear that they wanted fulfilling jobs , not work for its own sake .\\n`` The complaints were surprisingly uniform , '' Graeber recalled .\\n`` Basically they were all saying , ' I want to do something with my life that actually benefits others ; but if I go into a line of work where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so little , and they put so much in debt , that I ca n't even take care of my own family !\\nThis is ridiculous ! '\\n'' This brings us back to Ocasio-Cortez and her `` controversial '' idea that people who are unwilling to work should n't be left to die .\\nOnly a few weeks after she posted that , Ocasio-Cortez indirectly returned to that belief when an audience member at SXSW asked her about whether automation would ruin lives by putting people out of work .\\n`` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specter of being automated out of work , '' Ocasio-Cortez explained .\\n`` We should be excited by that .\\nBut the reason we 're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you do n't have a job , you are left to die .\\nAnd that is , at its core , our problem . ''\\nThe good news is that this problem — of meaningless work and too much work — is n't unsolvable .\\nWhat Lafargue and Russell observed in the late 19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true today : We have the resources to create a world in which people work for fewer hours and have more free time .\\nWe could put a cap on how much wealth any individual or institution could accumulate , establish a universal basic income so that no one would live in poverty and have a strong centralized government to address existential crises like climate change , pandemics and chemical pollution ( an issue that gets overlooked : how plastics and other common products are making us infertile ) .\\nThat path seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 've been conditioned to believe that work is an absolute virtue and eliminating major class differences is unthinkable .\\nYet the truly radical proposition is that the vast majority of humanity should waste their lives working when they do not have to , just so a small fragment can indulge in excessive leisure because they are extremely wealthy .\\nIt is even more radical yet to claim that this should continue happening until , because the wealthy fail to address issues like climate change , they wind up destroying humanity altogether @\",\n",

Health authorities in several more states said this week that they would broaden eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to all adults , as a growing list of officials look for ways to accelerate third doses in hopes of heading off a potential new wave of the virus .\\n`` For Pfizer and Moderna , those who are 18 and over , go get the shot .\\nThere 's not any limitations on that .\\nObviously you should be six months after the second shot .\\nBut we want you to get the booster , '' Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy Beshear and Kansas Governor Laura Kelly made similar announcements on Wednesday .\\n`` Expanding access to booster shots will help us put an end to this deadly pandemic , '' Kelly said in a statement .\\nThe FDA could act this week to expand eligibility to all adults , but for now these state policies go beyond the recommendations of federal health officials .\\nWhile boosters are currently recommended for all adult recipients of Johnson & Johnson 's vaccine , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allows boosters for more limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors 65 and older , adults with underlying medical conditions , and those who live or work in `` high-risk settings . ''\\nThe average pace of booster shots has slowed nationwide for weeks , and so far , just 16.5 % of fully vaccinated adults have received a booster , according to the CDC .\\nAmong seniors , only two states — Vermont and Minnesota — have recorded a booster dose in more than half of their vaccinated adults 65 and older .\\n`` It should be a much simpler process .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and accessible for everyone to get their booster shot with the minimum burden and confusion , '' said Hutchinson .\\nOfficials in Arkansas said they had informed the Biden administration of their plans .\\nFederal authorities have been mulling whether to expand eligibility for booster shots nationwide , though officials have cautioned that a formal authorization and recommendation could still be weeks away as regulators weigh the risks of rare side effects linked to the shots .\\n`` You 're balancing those two things and making sure that everybody has a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said last week , in an interview with WebMD .\\nThe latest announcements follow two states that last week declared all of their state 's adult residents eligible for booster shots , ahead of the federal sign-off .\\nColorado and New Mexico said their entire states are `` high risk '' enough to need third doses , pointing to federal guidance which currently allows for adults `` who work or live in high-risk settings '' to receive booster shots six months after they were first vaccinated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially said that this recommendation for Pfizer and Moderna boosters was intended for occupations at `` increased risk of being exposed to the virus , '' like first responders or teachers , or congregate settings like prisons and homeless shelters where the agency has recently tracked surges of breakthrough infections .\\nBut a state health official confirmed to CBS News that Colorado informally consulted with the CDC to greenlight its plan to expand eligibility for all adults .\\n`` I 've been very frustrated with the convoluted messaging out of the CDC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster after six months .\\nThe data is incredibly clear that it increases your personal protection level .\\nThat 's why my parents got it .\\nI got it .\\nMy family members got it , '' Colorado Governor Jared Polis told `` Face the Nation '' on Sunday .\\nA CDC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment specifically on the move , saying only that providers `` should administer vaccine in accordance '' with the current FDA emergency use authorization and CDC provider agreement .\\nAsked about the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doling out booster shots to all adults , authorities in New Mexico said their move `` trumps CDC guidance '' for providers in the state .\\n`` Vaccinators are protected , '' said Matt Bieber , a spokesperson for New Mexico 's Department of Health .\\nOther jurisdictions have also looked for different avenues to broaden access to booster shots , with New York City announcing on Monday that it was ordering providers not to turn away any adults looking for booster shots .\\nWhile providers are generally allowed to prescribe medicines `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the FDA on the private market , the CDC has previously warned vaccine providers that they could face penalties , lose pandemic liability protections , and may not be reimbursed for shots if they defied the agency 's recommendations governing use of the government-purchased COVID-19 vaccine .\\nHowever , the CDC has also long urged jurisdictions to remove hurdles for vaccinations , allowing adults to `` self-attest '' whether they were eligible .\\nGovernors in West Virginia and New Jersey on Monday also urged adult residents to get booster shots , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for the third doses .\\nUltimately New York City 's order , like California 's guidance last week , may amount to codifying a vaccination policy that had been relying largely on the honor system .\\n`` The state 's guidance on boosters is in alignment with the CDC .\\nIt is simplified to help empower more Californians to get a booster .\\nCalifornia has asked vaccine providers to not turn anyone away who has made the self-determination that they need a booster , '' said a spokesperson for California 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster shot ?\\nThe renewed push for booster shots comes as some of the Biden administration 's top doctors have redoubled calls for the third doses , ahead of FDA and CDC decisions on whether to expand eligibility nationwide for all

president 's chief medical adviser , told The New York Times last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vaccine advisers rejected Pfizer 's initial request to license booster shots for all American adults earlier this year , a growing body of evidence has continued to suggest protection from the vaccines is waning , even as rates of cases and deaths remain far higher among the unvaccinated .\\nOne recent study examining records from the Veterans Health Administration , published earlier this month in Science , found that as the Delta variant surged , effectiveness against symptomatic infections dropped to

       "  'COVID-19 is surging in Arizona schools, but parents are left in the dark. As COVID-19 infections surge in Arizona schools , sickening thousands of students and staff and forcing thousands more into quarantine , parents — and the public at large — have been left without a comprehensive picture of where Arizona students and educators are contracting the virus .\\nA patchwork of outbreak and quarantine notifications from school districts has sown confusion among families about the scope of on-campus exposure .\\nAnd while districts report infection data to county health officials , who in turn submit it to the state , that information is seldom relayed back to the public in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis has found .\\nJust 30 % of Arizona ’ s 215 traditional school districts provide public-facing dashboards that track outbreaks by school , according to AZCIR ’ s review of their websites .\\nOf the state ’ s 15 county health departments , only Pima County publicly monitors active COVID-19 cases by district .\\nThe state , meanwhile , does not specifically show where school- and day care-based outbreaks are occurring .\\nIt offers only county-level totals and a running tally of infections among Arizonans 19 and under .\\nThe lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting Arizona schools comes at a time when the rate of COVID-19 transmission among children is poised to surpass that of older age groups for the first time , research conducted by the University of Arizona ’ s Dr. Joe Gerald shows .\\nThough severe infections are less common among children than adults , they do happen , as do pediatric deaths from COVID-19 .\\nAnd in a state that recently topped 1 million cumulative cases , medical experts said the consequences of school-based outbreaks aren ’ t limited to kids .\\nSending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements , school-based testing or high overall vaccination rates has the potential to accelerate COVID transmission statewide , according to Gerald , who oversees UA ’ s public health policy and management program .\\nArizonans under 15 now represent about 25 % of COVID-19 cases , up from 10 % during the winter 2020 spike , his analysis of state data shows .\\nThe overall percentage of Arizonans testing positive for the virus also continues to climb .\\n“ With continued K–12 in-person instruction , plus opening of our major universities , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and young adults ” in the coming weeks , Gerald wrote .\\n“ If transmission in these groups spill over , then another surge of cases and hospitalizations similar to that of the summer of 2020 remains possible.\\n” Dr. Chris Beyrer , an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , said having a “ more systematic , ” more transparent strategy for preventing and tracking school-based cases would go a long way toward curbing the spread of the virus .\\n“ What we have is a patchwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies and practices , ” Beyrer said .\\n“ While local nuances are important , there ’ s nothing like rational statewide and national planning to get this right .\\nAnd we ’ re just not there.\\n” Frustrated parents turn to each other A 2020 emergency measure from the Department of Health Services requires Arizona schools and child care establishments to report COVID-19 outbreaks to local county health departments within 24 hours .\\nCounty officials must share the information with the state using Arizona ’ s Medical Electronic Disease Surveillance Intelligence System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not required by law to post it online .\\nMost don ’ t , with the exception of Pima and Maricopa counties .\\nPima alone pinpoints where outbreaks are occurring ; Maricopa County reports only numbers of active and resolved school outbreaks .\\nIn counties without comprehensive school-outbreak dashboards , the decision to publicize school-level case and quarantine data is left to individual districts .\\nThe Arizona Department of Education said in a statement that it “ has urged all public schools to communicate transparently about school-related outbreaks with staff , students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .\\n“ Now , as cases , particularly in children , are rapidly increasing , families need the best information possible to stay safe and slow the spread of the virus , ” ADE spokesperson Morgan Dick wrote in an email .\\n“ ADE recognizes this can be incredibly challenging for some school communities , given limited resources and capacity .\\nNevertheless , robust , transparent communication is vital to keeping our schools safe and healthy , and ultimately able to operate and provide in-person instruction.\\n” While school officials don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases or exposures , they do have to alert parents if their child was in close contact with a known COVID-19 case , typically via email or letters sent home .\\nAs of late August , some schools were sending home advisories daily or almost daily .\\nThe nearly 150 advisories submitted to AZCIR ’ s school-based outbreak tracker in August indicate the level of detail provided in school notifications varies .\\nSome letters tell parents that their child could have been in contact with someone on campus who “ may ” have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others confirm numbers of new cases and specify the last day a COVID-positive student or staffer was at school .\\nThe resulting confusion is palpable on social media platforms , where parents have flocked in an attempt to piece together how the virus is hitting their kids ’ classrooms , bus routes and after-school programs .\\nMany have uploaded alerts from schools or reported outbreaks , seeking to compare notes .\\n“ There is a covid outbreak at Franklin Elementary East campus , ” one Mesa Public Schools parent posted on Twitter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mpsaz elementary schools are experiencing outbreaks ?\\n” A few days later , a BASIS Charter Schools parent posted that parents in that school system “ are sharing covid+ case announcement emails with each other , since our schools only update trackers 1/week.\\n” “ Every single day the past 1.5 weeks has been stressful , ” she wrote .\\nSome families have formed private Facebook groups to jointly track outbreaks and exposures as they navigate an uncertain school year .\\nOthers are logging numbers on their own .\\nQueen Creek dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler Unified School District data to calculate that about 2 % of the student and staff population at his sons ’ high school , Casteel , had been infected with COVID-19 during the first month of school .\\nHe said he suspects the total is higher given the number of students not in class .\\nLike many other school districts , Chandler Unified does not isolate new cases on its daily dashboard , listing only “ active ” and “ resolved ” counts , nor does it quantify the number of students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus .\\nThe district also erases past dashboard entries , which makes it difficult to track patterns over time , according to Flowers .\\n“ You can get to the information , but it ’ s not being honest with people , ” Flowers said .\\n“ I mean , you should be able to see every day how many new cases are showing up in your school , how many new cases are showing up in the district.\\n” Chandler Unified spokesman Terry Locke said the primary goal of the dashboard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a school is approaching thresholds that may lead to additional mitigation , ” and officials “ update the number of active cases daily to allow the public to review trends.\\n” “ We are limited in manpower to compile additional data , so compiling quarantine numbers ( is ) not feasible , ” he wrote in an email .\\nEpidemiologist : Those under 12 at heightened risk Frustration over the lack of comprehensive outbreak information comes on top of ongoing tensions related to a law signed by Republican Gov .\\nDoug Ducey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring masks .\\nThough the law doesn ’ t take effect until Sept. 29 — assuming a pending lawsuit seeking to block it does not succeed — the majority of school districts in the state have opted not to mandate face coverings .\\nMore than 30 districts and several higher education institutions have , though some have broad opt-out policies .\\nBeyrer , the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist , argued inconsistent mask coverage has left Arizona students of all age groups unnecessarily vulnerable to infection upon returning to classrooms .\\nThose under age 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are at particular risk , he said , with “ an increasing number of kids of this age in the hospital.\\n” Among August COVID-19 hospitalizations in Maricopa County , about 6 % were children , with kids under 12 representing one in six COVID cases overall , according to county health officials .\\nBefore the school year began , children constituted about 3 % of Maricopa County ’ s COVID hospitalizations .\\nWhile those 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine , vaccination rates among that population remain low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more autonomous and more social , mixing in different ways than children do , which makes them “ more important in community spread , ” Beyrer said .\\nAnd kids of any age can get so-called long haul COVID-19—where symptoms such as fatigue , headaches , dizziness and shortness of breath can persist indefinitely—even if they have a relatively mild case , Beyrer said .\\n“ We ’

       " 12: [\"Horseshoes and widow's peaks: Why do men go bald in different patterns?. In a 1997 episode of `` Seinfeld , '' a character named Kurt learns to his dismay that he is going bald .\\nHis dismay does n't stem from his aversion to being hairless ; in fact , he is a swimmer , and is used to shaving his cranium to better compete .\\nBut when he learns that he may become involuntarily bald , he sinks into a state of impulsivity and depression .\\nWhile most bald people do not react as poorly as the `` Seinfeld '' swimmer , the episode does accurately capture a basic truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not simply that men are self-conscious , but that male pattern baldness imparts a feeling of disempowerment over their appearance .\\n`` Male pattern baldness or Androgenetic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss , affecting up to 80 % of men in their lifetime , '' Dr. Kristen Lo Sicco , an associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Health , told Salon by email .\\n`` About 75 % of people with Androgenetic alopecia have at least one family member with this type of hair loss . ''\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery of baldness , and the lack of control over it .\\nIt is distressing for any human to feel that one 's body is out of one 's control , that it is doing things without our consent .\\nYet science has a sense of why , and how , baldness happens — and why men ( and sometimes women ) lose power over their hair .\\nThere is , apparently , a connection between a chemical that we associate with masculinity — testosterone — and the looming threat that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who suffers from male pattern baldness has hair follicles that sensitive to the testosterone metabolite , or dehydrotestosterone .\\nLike the color of your eyes or shape of your earlobe , the structure of your hairline is actually quite individual and says a great deal about you .\\nUntil recently , scientists did n't have a particularly comprehensive knowledge about different types of hairlines .\\nThat 's because early major classification systems tended to mostly or entirely study only one race ( Caucasian men , Japanese men ) .\\nIn 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. O'Tar Norwood studied male pattern baldness in over 1,000 males and came up with the system most commonly used today .\\nAccording to Norwood 's system , most hair loss begins at the temples and gradually recedes back , eventually leaving a peninsula of hair in the middle of the scalp .\\nIf the baldness continues , that peninsula will become more narrow while the hair on the crown starts to thin out .\\nIf your baldness insists on defoliating your cranium even further , the peninsula will start to shrink the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown .\\nWhen the two areas of baldness finally meet , you will be left with nothing but a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair .\\nThere is one variant to this system , which Norwood dubbed `` Type A . ''\\nIts main features are that it deprives the early balding man of that precious peninsula but spares him that initial thinning on the crown .\\nInstead , like a retreating army destined to be court marshaled for abandoning their position , the hair at the front simply gives up the fight and allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape atop one 's skull .\\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox ?\\nSubscribe to Salon 's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist .\\nAnalogies aside , there are straightforward scientific explanations for why one 's hair seems to abandon you .\\nThe truth is that , with male pattern baldness , the hair is n't falling off of your head in unusually large quantities .\\n( Hair is supposed to fall out , after all . )\\nIt is rather that the hair does n't grow back as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to cause the appearance of balding , '' Lo Sicco explained .\\nThe first is called `` miniaturization .\\n`` This means the hair shafts are becoming smaller and smaller in caliber ( thickness ) over time , '' Lo Sicco continued .\\nThe second is `` shortening of the growth phase of hair , '' known as `` the anagen phase . ''\\n`` This means less hair will be on the scalp and will become shorter , '' Lo Sicco said .\\n`` This is because the length of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anagen phase . ''\\nThe type of hairline that you wind up with depends on how your biological chemistry impacts the hair follicles at different locations on your head .\\nLikewise , it turns out there is also a reason that bald men continue growing hair on the back and sides of their head — the `` horseshoe '' pattern of hair , as sported by celebrities like Larry David and the late James Gandolfini .\\n`` The hair on the top and front of the scalp is susceptible to androgens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not ( occipital scalp ) , '' Lo Sicco wrote .\\n`` This theory is known as 'donor dominance , ' pioneered by Dr. Orentreich who developed hair transplantation in the US while at the NYU Skin & Cancer Unit . ''\\nWhile it is easy to joke about male pattern baldness , it is not a harmless medical condition .\\nDepending on the stage and severity , baldness has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease ( although the extent of that risk is still debated ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate cancer .\\nThe exact mechanisms are unknown , however , as much still remains to be learned about the exact mechanisms behind baldness .\",\n",

Corruption in the United Kingdom is once again in the news .\\nConservative Party MPs have been caught with their hands in the till , abusing their positions to pad their bank accounts .\\nThe regime of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has attempted a cover-up – trying to use its majority in the lower house to pass laws muzzling the anti-graft watchdog , who in turn has reportedly received death threats .\\nNewspaper editorials are decrying “ sleaze ” – a catchall phrase for questionable and scandalous conduct – in the oil-rich kingdom where , since the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest , a third of MPs have pocketed nearly $ 7m in payments for moonlighting with private firms , including those bidding for contracts related to pandemic measures .\\nFurther , the ruling party has also been accused of selling seats in the upper chamber of parliament , the House of Lords , to donors for up to $ 4m .\\nIt is not the first time the public in the ethnically divided country , which is plagued by tribal separatist movements in the regions of Scotland and Northern Ireland , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a report published by the National Audit Office , just over 1 percent of COVID-19 contracts worth $ 24bn awarded to suppliers between March and July last year , were awarded using a competitive process .\\nThe process was shrouded in secrecy , with a local court ruling that the then-health minister , Matt Hancock , had broken the law by failing to publish details of contracts within the required 30 days .\\nIn fact , the government introduced a “ high-priority lane ” which gave special treatment to suppliers recommended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the opposition shadow cabinet office minister would describe as “ an unedifying gold rush of chums and chancers ” .\\nCorruption in the high echelons of British power has not been reserved to the pandemic era .\\nA decade ago , for example , parliamentarians in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords were caught up in a scheme involving widespread abuse of claims for allowances and expenses worth at least $ 2m , for which several were forced to resign and others sent to jail .\\nThe pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frequent practice of the ruling elite .\\nThe whole country has been identified as an international hub for tax evasion and money laundering as well as a major destination for illicit financial flows from across the globe .\\nIt controls a “ spider ’ s web ” of territories and dependencies ( where the British government has full powers to impose or veto lawmaking ) which , according to the Tax Justice Network , “ operates as a global web of tax havens laundering and shifting money into and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top abettor of theft and corruption .\\nYet it is interesting that when discussing corruption in the kingdom , where , according to the humanitarian agency FareShare , one in every eight people struggles to afford enough to eat , few ever describe it as a cultural problem in the same way corruption is described when encountered in Africa .\\n“ The African is corrupt through and through … They are all corrupt .\\nThe fact that over countless centuries the African has been a victim of the worst climate in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault .\\nBut he has been sapped mentally and physically .\\nWe brought him Western education .\\nBut what use is it to him ?\\n” says Mr Green , the white senior civil servant in Chinua Achebe ’ s novel , No Longer at Ease .\\nWhile many may be averse to openly expressing such sentiment in today ’ s post- # BlackLivesMatter days , a glance at newspaper reports , both on and off the continent , would reveal that the intrinsic corruption of the African is nonetheless a widely held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the post-colonial state : how the west invented African corruption , racism scholar Gabriel Apata notes , that while corruption is universal , “ when it comes to Africa , [ corruption ] has remained a permanent black mark that will not shift , an idea that encapsulates the African predicament in all its various shades and manifestations ” .\\nHe shows how media descriptions of it often present it as a form of pathology : “ a cancer , virus , epidemic , cankerworm and so forth , these descriptions evoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV-AIDS whose origins lie in Africa … Nowhere else or about no other continent is corruption described in these terms.\\n” This is despite the fact that African scholars have long traced the roots of corruption to colonialism .\\nAs Kenyan author Joe Khamisi notes in his book Looters and Grabbers : 54 Years of Corruption and Plunder by the Elite 1963-2017 , the role of colonialism in establishing corruption practices has not stopped attempts to portray them as a legacy of the pre-colonial past – including as a consequence of a wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out gifts to “ chiefs ” who , ironically , are themselves another colonial invention .\\nSuch attempts to indigenise graft follow the path of other invented and supposedly “ African ” realities such as the “ tribe ” .\\nAs Apata points out , the corruption prototype “ emerged out of Western neo-liberal capitalist tradition and its exploitative tendencies , a system that was exported to Africa and which in turn became Africanised ” .\\nIn this sense , the corruption found especially in “ Black Africa ” is presented as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlightened practices of the “ developed ” West .\\nSo while they may both have corrupt officials who abuse their power to rip off their citizens , the corrupt European politician is presented as a societal aberration , a negation of its wholesome values , while the corrupt African official is taken as the embodiment of African values .\\nThis racialised approach is also reflected in the different language used to describe practices that look very similar .\\nMPs in the UK are paid by companies to “ lobby ” for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ high-priority lane ” .\\nWhen much the same thing happens in Kenya , MPs are said to have received “ bribes ” and money is “ funnelled ” into the pockets of their corrupt benefactors in the private sector .\\nWhen public officials steal money from Africans , their countries quickly earn themselves the unhappy distinction of being “ corrupt ” .\\nYet when the same money is hidden , as revealed by the Pandora Papers , in Western tax havens , with the help of Western consultants , firms and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n“ It has caused me the greatest trouble , and forever causes me the greatest trouble , to perceive that unspeakably more depends upon what things are called , than on what they are , ” wrote German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche .\\nThis is undoubtedly true of the Western worldview regarding corruption .\\nThe attempt to essentialise and exoticise “ African corruption ” only serves to obscure its real roots and to sanitise the same behaviour in the West .\\nAnd as Nietzsche went on to note , “ the appearance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence in the end , and operates as the essence ” .\\nThe views expressed in this article are the author ’ s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera ’ s editorial stance .'],\n",

Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) led several Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee on a two-day visit to McAllen this week where they witnessed the ongoing border crisis , and all the members — as they recapped their visit — said the Biden administration was at fault for surging numbers of illegal migrants .\\nBorder Patrol agents apprehended nearly 170,000 migrants crossing the southern border illegally in March , a 72 percent increase from February .\\nAs Breitbart News reported , in the first two full months of President Joe Biden ’ s time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehensions were at a combined total of nearly 210,000 , while in the last four months of former President Donald Trump ’ s tenure , apprehensions were at a combined total of just over 280,000 .\\nJordan , the ranking Republican member on the Judiciary Committee , gathered from speaking with Border Patrol agents that the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols ( MPP ) program , also known as Remain in Mexico — which Biden ’ s Department of Homeland Security suspended on his first day as president — is imperative to reinstate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influx .\\nJordan told Breitbart News on Wednesday near the conclusion of his visit , “ This is … not just Jim Jordan talking , not just Republican members of the Judiciary Committee talking .\\nThis is the Border Patrol agents themselves , what they ’ re telling us .\\nThat ’ s what we ’ ve got to get done , and we have to talk about this and try to persuade our Democratic colleagues this is just good common sense .\\nThis is for the good of the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of these kids and these families who are making that treacherous trek up through Mexico to get here.\\n” The MPP program allowed border officials to return asylum-seeking migrants back to Mexico while they await the processing of their claims , which the Trump administration at the time of implementing the program , in January 2019 , said would serve as a deterrent for illegal migration and help control an “ unprecedented number ” of “ fraudulent asylum claims.\\n” Opponents of the MPP program argue sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creates nearly insurmountable barriers to being granted asylum if they do actually qualify for it .\\nHowever , as Rep. Andy Biggs ( R-AZ ) detailed during a roundtable the delegation attended Wednesday , halting the MPP program has served as one cause — among several other Biden policies — of what has now become America ’ s “ massive humanitarian crisis.\\n” “ We know that it ’ s policy driven , ” Biggs said .\\n“ We know that it ’ s this Biden administration ’ s policies that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ?\\nBecause we simply have to look at when those policies were in place .\\nI ’ m talking MPP , the Remain in Mexico policy .\\nI ’ m talking about the agreements with the Northern Triangle states , with Guatemala , El Salvador , and Honduras .\\nI ’ m talking about the incentive factor .\\nWe all respond to incentives .\\nHow about $ 1,400 per illegal alien in the COVID relief package ?\\nHow about a free education ?\\nHow about , you ’ ll get transported wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ’ re in , it ’ s almost impossible for you to be sent out , and that ’ s really what ’ s going on .\\nAnd so , President Trump found a problem , and he solved it .\\nPresident Biden saw a solution and now he ’ s dissolved that and created a massive humanitarian crisis.\\n” Biggs , at a press conference later on Wednesday , referred to comments Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador made : “ That ’ s why the president of Mexico said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Biden ’ s mess.\\n” Rep. Dan Bishop ( R-NC ) , who also attended the trip , agreed asylum claims are a “ predicate for people entering the country.\\n” He told Breitbart News of the MPP program , “ It was an innovative , strategic policy to eliminate the perverse incentive in asylum claims .\\nThey can assert their asylum right , but you don ’ t want as the price of that to have any unlimited numbers of people coming into the country.\\n” The House Judiciary Committee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration policy .\\nJordan said at the press conference the committee ’ s Democrat members were invited on the trip and declined the invitation .\\nBreitbart News reached out to committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler ( D-NY ) to inquire about the reason for this and did not receive an immediate response .\\nRep. Tom McClintock ( R-CA ) , the lead Republican on the committee ’ s subcommittee on immigration , said the Biden administration also shares blame for the swell of illegal migration because of his 100-day moratorium on most deportations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s executive order on returning criminal illegals , deporting them after they ’ ve served their terms , now essentially makes the United States a sanctuary nation , ” McClintock said during the roundtable .\\nDespite a federal judge blocking Biden ’ s moratorium in February , a Wall Street Journal analysis found Immigration and Customs Enforcement ’ s job priorities have still changed under the new administration ’ s policies as indicated by a drop of 50 percent in deportations in March compared with deportations in the months at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) issued a memo on his first day in office justifying calling for the moratorium , saying DHS must “ surge resources ” to the southern border to “ ensure safe , legal , and orderly processing , to rebuild fair and effective asylum procedures that respect human rights and due process … and to prioritize responding to threats to national security , public safety , and border security.\\n” The delegation ’ s consensus , however , was that Biden ’ s immigration policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnet for illegal migration and resulted in what has become growing and uncontrollable numbers of illegal migrants .\\nTwo other members of the Judiciary Committee in attendance , Rep. Victoria Spartz ( R-IN ) and Rep. Burgess Owens ( R-UT ) , railed against Biden for failing to acknowledge the issue .\\n“ Not dealing with this issue , not looking at the policies , I think it ’ s a complete lack of leadership and disregard , ” Spartz told Breitbart News .\\nOwens surmised , “ It ’ s either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n”',\n",

It has never been clear how effective a chief of staff Mark Meadows proved to be for Donald Trump .\\nTrump always has been too concerned with self over governing .\\nBut it was clear in hearing out the Jan. 6 committee that Meadows came across to that group as a willful buffoon .\\nThe Jan. 6 Select Congressional Committee dramatically dispatched Meadows last night with a recommended 9-0 contempt of Congress vote .\\nIt was as dripping in scorn and disappointment for a former colleague ’ s disrespect to the House as it was filled with questions that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems certain that Meadows is headed for a full House contempt vote , which could come as early as Tuesday , and recommended prosecution for refusing to answer his subpoena , as with Trump adviser Steve Bannon .\\nBut the case against Meadows suggests actual criminal complicity in a conspiracy to overthrow the government through the subversion of electoral votes .\\nThe committee , with seven Democrats and two Republicans , openly mocked Meadows ’ claims of executive privilege clearly thrust upon him by Trump .\\nMeadows already had turned over 9,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records to the panel ; he has published and promoted a book purporting to discuss exact topics for which the committee has questions ; he took part in television interviews in which he covered similar ground in political cover for his former boss .\\nIndeed , after the committee had disclosed that the documents included in a Jan. 5 email which , per the White House , said the National Guard was on standby to “ protect pro-Trump people.\\n” Anyone following the inquiries into the insurrection attempt would have serious questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\\nBefore television cameras , the Republicans and Democrats on the panel made clear that the contempt they felt for a former colleague reflected personal contempt as well as the more official sort .\\nFor years , Meadows , former ranking member of the Government and Operations Committee and leader of the House Freedom Caucus until taking over as Trump ’ s top counselor , was strident in calling out members of the Barack Obama administration who did not satisfy his own subpoenas and questions .\\nAt this hearing , committee members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with other unnamed Republican Congress members to derail the Jan. 6 election certification ; in repeated meetings with conspiracists aiming to overthrow the election results ; and as a go-between among Congress members under siege , Trump family members and Trump himself as the Jan. 6 violence continued to play out .\\nAs The Times noted , according to dozens of text messages that members of the panel read aloud , Meadows fielded requests from terrified lawmakers and even members of Trump ’ s family begging for Meadows to persuade Trump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was neck-deep in attempts to overturn election results .\\nHe traveled to Georgia on Trump ’ s behalf before that phone call in which Trump asked the secretary of state to “ find ” sufficient votes to change the outcome .\\nThe committee report detailed communications showing that Meadows met with and coordinated information in a 38-page PowerPoint on how state delegations , Congress members and Vice President Mike Pence could stop the certification by ordering martial law and tossing votes ; and he coordinated with Jan. 6 rally organizers .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a blank check to refuse a House subpoena particularly to answer a whole lot of questions that fall outside any direct advisory communications with Trump .\\nFor that matter , we ’ re seeing the same refusal attitude extending now to former trade representative Peter Navarro before a different committee looking at Covid policies .\\nAll there was on the other side was ordered silence – and a legal lawsuit that the subpoena was overly broad .\\nBut , to anyone listening to the hearing , the committee ’ s questions all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the missing link here is Trump himself , who is stopping anyone from testifying whose recollections might show him in an unfavorable light .\\nAs I have argued previously , if Trump believes in his own legal cause , it is maddening that he doesn ’ t stand up and testify proudly about his actions before , during and since .\\nIt all would be absurd if it were not so deadly serious .\\nJan 6 was a symptom , not the disease itself .\\nWe ’ re watching our election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under continuing attack by a populism that demands authoritarianism – and a Donald Trump who wants to return to don that monarchial crown .\\nTrump ’ s PowerPoint coup plotters were crackpots , argues Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank , who adds , “ We may not be so lucky next time.\\n” The hearing itself was only 45 minutes , an effective round-robin of congressional outrage that left only one question : Where is the Justice Department ’ s parallel investigation of those who led and planned the overthrow of our government @',\n",

House Republicans plan to vote Wednesday on whether to strip Representative Liz Cheney of her leadership post in the House as a result of her criticisms of former President Trump and his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him .\\nThe highest-ranking two Republicans in the House want Cheney to be replaced with Representative Elise Stefanik , a staunch Trump ally , as GOP Conference chair .\\nCheney wo n't give up the spot willingly , and she plans to force the conference to vote on whether to remove her , according to a source familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` I will not sit back '' in speech on eve of vote to remove her from leadership post In a defiant speech on the House floor Tuesday night , on the eve of the vote , Cheney said she will not `` watch in silence '' amid Mr. Trump 's baseless claims that the election was stolen from him .\\n`` This is not about policy , this is not about partisanship , this is about our duty as Americans , '' Cheney said .\\n`` Remaining silent and ignoring the lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in that .\\nI will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president 's crusade to undermine our democracy . ''\\nIf the conference chooses to remove Cheney , as House Republican leadership expects it to , the vote will trigger an overhaul of the GOP 's messaging , further solidifying it as the party of Mr. Trump .\\nThe House Republican Conference is simply the organizational body for all the GOP members in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair is responsible for scheduling meetings where members can discuss issues and legislation within their own party .\\nBut the chair also has a major role in party messaging , both coordinating media availabilities and interviews with members and speaking on behalf of the caucus .\\nThe job gives Cheney the third-highest position among House Republicans , behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise .\\nHowever , conference chairs have seldom reached higher positions within the party .\\nWhy is Cheney 's leadership post at risk ?\\nCheney is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair because she has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump and rejected his unfounded theories about the election , while other members of House GOP leadership and some members have stood behind the former president and his claims .\\nShe began publicly breaking with McCarthy over how the party should handle Trump after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol January 6 .\\nShe called for Trump to be impeached for his role in the event and later voted to impeach him , while McCarthy urged members to move forward .\\nFor her impeachment vote , Cheney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as conference chair in early February .\\nAt the meeting , McCarthy strongly advised members against unseating Cheney as well as removing Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments for promoting conspiracy theories and apparently endorsing violence toward Democratic politicians .\\nIn both cases , the conference voted overwhelmingly not to take action .\\nJust 61 Republicans voted to remove Cheney from her post , while 145 voted for her to stay in the vote by secret ballot .\\nBut days later , the GOP in Cheney 's home state of Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impeach Mr. Trump .\\nIn late April at House Republicans ' annual retreat in Florida , the fracturing grew between Cheney and pro-Trump members when Cheney told reporters `` our elected leaders are the ones who are in charge , '' as opposed to Mr. Trump .\\nSince , Cheney has continued to challenge Mr. Trump 's benefit to the party as well as his baseless claims that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election .\\n`` While embracing or ignoring Trump 's statements might seem attractive to some for fundraising and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term damage to our party and our country , '' Cheney wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week .\\nAlmost immediately , McCarthy and Scalise began taking steps behind the scenes to unseat Cheney from her conference chair post .\\nSince then , both of them have said they support Cheney 's removal and replacement with Stefanik .\\n`` Each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future , '' McCarthy wrote to GOP members Monday .\\n`` These internal conflicts need to be resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of our collective team .\\nHaving heard from so many of you in recent days , it 's clear that we need to make a change . ''\\nHow will the vote work ?\\nRepresentative Virginia Foxx , a House veteran who 's facing a far-right primary challenger in her reelection battle , is expected to introduce a resolution to remove Cheney from the job when the conference meets Wednesday , according to sources familiar with the plans .\\nThe vote is expected to be done by secret ballot or by voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was the previous one , according to two sources familiar with the process .\\nBecause there are 218 Republican members in the House , at least 110 would need to vote against Cheney to remove her .\\nIf the attempt to oust her is successful , the conference would then need to elect a replacement chair .\\nThat election would likely take place at a later conference meeting , leaving time for a candidate forum in between , according to sources familiar with the plans .\\nLike all conference meetings , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed doors .\\nWho could be the next GOP Conference chair ?\\nStefanik , a four-term congresswoman from upstate New York , is the current frontrunner to be the next GOP Conference chair if Cheney loses the job .\\nStefanik was an establishment Republican who worked for former President George W. Bush and former House Speaker Paul Ryan .\\nDuring the 2016 election , Stefanik was so reluctant to embrace Mr. Trump that she referred to him as `` my party 's presidential nominee , '' rather than by his name .\\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former president a year and a half ago , Stefanik had become one of his staunchest allies on the Hill .\\nOn Monday , he repaid her for her loyalty .\\n`` The House GOP has a massive opportunity to upgrade this week from warmonger Liz Cheney to gifted communicator Elise Stefanik .\\nElise has intelligence , an endorsement from American Patriot Brandon Judd and the National Border Patrol Council , she has an A+ from the NRA , and she loves our Veterans , '' Mr. Trump said in a statement .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members win election and reelection .\\nHer Elevate PAC donated to nearly 50 Republican women running for House spots the last election cycle .\\nStill , Stefanik 's moderate history worries some in the GOP as it coalesces around the former president 's ideals .\\nThe Conservative Club for Growth PAC last week said in a statement that Stefanik has among the most liberal voting records in the House GOP .\\n`` House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority , '' the group said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucus have already come out against Cheney .\\nRepresentative Chip Roy sent a memo to members Tuesday indicating he wanted to hold off on putting Stefanik in the leadership post .\\n`` Therefore , with all due respect to my friend , Elise Stefanik , let us contemplate the message Republican leadership is about to send by rushing to coronate a spokesperson whose voting record embodies much of what led to the 2018 ass-kicking we received by Democrats , '' Roy wrote in the memo .\\nTo quell similar concerns among the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Freedom Caucus after the vote on Cheney , according to sources familiar with the plans .\\nShe has also told GOP members she plans to serve only one term as conference chair , according to a GOP aide .\\nBut Stefanik 's reaction to the January 6 riot at the Capitol stands in stark contrast to Cheney 's .\\nWhile Cheney called for Mr. Trump 's impeachment in the days that followed , Stefanik was unfazed .\\nShe returned to the House chamber after the event and unsuccessfully objected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the GOP 's plans confirms that there will be a candidate forum for potential candidates for the conference chair position on Thursday with an election planned for Friday .\\n`` Today we face a threat , America has never seen before '' In a speech on the House floor Tuesday night , Cheney was emphatic that `` the election is over . ''\\n`` Today we face a threat , America has never seen before , '' Cheney said .\\n`` A former president , who provoked a violent attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal the election has resumed his aggressive efforts to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him .

I was chatting with my barber the other day and inquired why there ’ d been such a long wait for a spot in the chair that morning .\\\\nHer reply was unexpectedly mordant — and blunt : Only one person had been available to do the cutting when the shop opened because “ we can ’ t get anyone to work.\\\\n” “ Don ’ t you know that ’ s a myth ?\\\\n” I replied ironically .\\\\nShe smirked and continued clipping away .\\\\nThese days George Orwell is every conservative ’ s go-to guy for punchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a “ right-winger ” himself — by his own assertion , in fact , a “ democratic socialist ” .\\\\nThat doesn ’ t mean he ’ d be enamored with the likes of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi .\\\\nIt ’ s plausible he ’ d be horrified by most contemporary Western liberals .\\\\nOr Democrats .\\\\nRecall , Orwell is the celebrated epigrammarian who first said , “ the restatement of the obvious is the first duty of intelligent men.\\\\n” In this regard , the above Leftists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as “ anti-Orwells ” .\\\\nThey seem fixated on dismissing , even disguising , the glaringly self-evident about so much ; unemployment numbers included .\\\\nOf course , for exhibit A I have in mind President Joe Biden .\\\\nAfter two disappointing monthly job reports in a row — April ’ s downright catastrophically so — he ’ s unshakably assured us there ’ s zilch truth to the charge that millions of unemployed Americans are forgoing an employment search because COVID-19 relief payments are making it more lucrative to remain loitering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s been a lot of discussion … that people are being paid to stay home rather than go to work , ” admitted the Chief Exec .\\\\nBut then : “ Well , we don ’ t see much evidence of that.\\\\n” Despite abysmal job-creation stats , Biden scoffed at what he waved off as “ loose talk that Americans just don ’ t want to work.\\\\n” So , that settles the economic debate , Mr. President ?\\\\nPoint of fact , anecdotal indicators and a trove of collected data ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) signal there is , indeed , a hiring problem .\\\\nThis also tracks with common sense : as my father has said , “ Pay people not to work and they won ’ t work.\\\\n” That truism isn ’ t rendered inoperative just because the “ don ’ t work ” payments are gussied up as “ COVID-relief ” .\\\\nOr because our forty-sixth president says it ain ’ t so .\\\\nExperience affirms you generally get more of what you subsidize financially — in this latest case , we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gladly cooperating .\\\\nThe editors at National Review put it this way in their June 1 edition : “ One thing the government is good at doing is getting more of what it pays for : in this case , idleness.\\\\n” As with everything in life , there are doubtless exceptions to this pattern , but it does appear to be a genuine , broad and regrettably debilitating phenomenon .\\\\nApplying some available street smarts to the matter should have predicted all this long ago .\\\\nWe are seeing the debasement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the economic front .\\\\n… All the Biden folks needed to do was stop gazing into their cracked crystal ball and go outside and ask business owners if they can find workers .\\\\n… Instead , the liberals paid attention to some cockamamie econometric model saying you can pay people more not to work and it won ’ t change their behavior .\\\\nBrilliant .\\\\n… Here is a simple , ironclad law of economics for the “ science ” mob on the left .\\\\nIf you tax something , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , you get more of it .\\\\nPundit Larry Elder lays it out for the reality-resistant : Now let ’ s see , where did this Administration put that Occam ’ s Razor when they needed it ?\\\\nMarc Thiessen startlingly specifies “ a recent paper estimates that 48 percent of workers still make more from unemployment benefits than they would from working.\\\\n” Got that ?\\\\nClosing in on half of those who ought to be laboring are finding themselves better off waiting for their D.C- and state legislature-provided bail-out checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t stop with mere dollars : I lately heard a guy unembarrassedly chatting about the thousands of dollars he ’ s been receiving every month since this grand , tax-payer fueled giveaway began .\\\\nTo be clear , he ’ s collecting this scratch for doing nothing .\\\\nIn a Brobdingnagian case of understatement , regarding the money bonanza that ’ s been fire-hosed into his bank account since coronavirus lockdowns began , he blandly remarked , “ That helps ” .\\\\nConspicuous bottom line ?\\\\nThe chap ’ s in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the Washington Post reports a Department of Labor spokesperson agreeing with President Biden , avowing his shop “ has not seen evidence ” that the government monies incentivize indolence .\\\\nNo evidence , I suppose , other than centuries of consistent human experience , history and unforgiving real-world logic : Enable people to forswear employment — literally reward them for it — and they ’ ll settle into that unproductive path ;

Several years ago , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez released an overview of the Green New Deal that mentioned guaranteeing `` economic security \\'\\' for people who are `` unable or unwilling to work . \\'\\'\\\\nWhen conservative critics noticed those last three words , they pounced .\\\\nFox News waxed poetic about the `` dignity of work \\'\\' and Breitbart sneered at the `` self-described Democratic Socialist \\'\\' whose `` radical proposal \\'\\' ignored that even `` traditional American liberalism regarded full employment as its goal because of the importance of work to society and the individual . \\'\\'\\\\nIndeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one \\'s survival is tied to work — and , thus , those who do n\\'t work do n\\'t deserve to survive , or at least to not be poor .\\\\nYou can see this in the New Testament , where it is written that `` if a man will not work , he shall not eat \\'\\' and people are urged to `` settle down and earn the bread they eat . \\'\\'\\\\nOver time conservatives found ways of couching that belief in lofty rhetoric about the wonders of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees economic rights to all , somehow we \\'ll lose our most cherished freedoms .\\\\nEven Democrats have bought into this , most notably when Bill Clinton \\'s 1996 welfare reform bill threw millions of people off relief by limiting benefits and establishing as a policy priority that recipients eventually be forcibly transitioned back to work .\\\\nFlash forward two years , and one global pandemic , later .\\\\nJoe Biden just passed a historic $ 1.9 trillion stimulus bill to help the millions who are financially struggling as COVID-19 lockdowns spur job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from burnout , stress and exhaustion as their employment lives and domestic lives have involuntarily meshed while they work from home .\\\\nWe do n\\'t need studies to demonstrate how traumatizing this has been : Most of us are either stressed about making ends meet or stressed because the need to work for a living in these unusual times is physically and spiritually taxing .\\\\nYet the people who decide what ideas fall within the Overton window — or the spectrum of opinions deemed socially acceptable — only permit us to seek ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reevaluate it .\\\\nEven in the earliest days of the pandemic , right-wing commentators like Glenn Beck were urging older Americans to risk their lives by going to work lest the economy suffer as authorities tried to contain a deadly disease .\\\\nBillionaires became vastly wealthier during the pandemic while income inequality ( which was already out of control ) significantly worsened .\\\\nBut instead of questioning whether this redistribution of wealth was just or efficient , the political focus has been on `` getting people back to work \\'\\' no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home and not work until the pandemic is over ( which countries like the United Kingdom and Spain did to varying degrees ) were never seriously considered — even though scientifically this would have been the most effective way to contain the disease .\\\\nAfter all , if we did that , then people might start to question whether they should be forced to work to survive in the first place .\\\\nAnd we ca n\\'t have that because , well ... reasons .\\\\nBut what are those reasons , exactly ?\\\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy crashes — whether in the Great Depression of 1929 , the Great Recession of 2008 or now the Great Lockdowns of 2020 — the most we can hope for is that a moderate liberal like Franklin Roosevelt or Barack Obama will step in and mildly mitigate the damage ?\\\\nWhy do we take it for granted that people must , absolutely must , be forced to work in order to survive ?\\\\nWhy do we insist that anyone who even considers challenging that notion is a lazy and immoral mooch , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — even though , ironically , many of the world \\'s wealthiest heir and heiresses do no work themselves ?\\\\nWhat if there is a third way of looking at the concept of work , but we are so conditioned to reflexively believe that you must `` earn your living \\'\\' that we are failing to recognize it ?\\\\nOcasio-Cortez was not the first political thinker to ponder these things .\\\\nIn his 1932 essay `` In Praise of Idleness , \\'\\' philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that there are two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of matter at or near the earth \\'s surface relatively to other such matter ; second , telling other people to do so . \\'\\'\\\\nIn other words , all work is either manual labor or managing manual labor .\\\\nAs Russell quipped : `` The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid ; the second is pleasant and highly paid . \\'\\'\\\\nAlthough the first type of work , manual labor , is necessary to some degree , Russell says that it `` is emphatically not one of the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to significantly reduce the amount of labor necessary to provide everyone with their necessities .\\\\nArguing that all human beings should still have to spend most of their days working , even though such work is unnecessary for society and often cruel to the individual , is irrational and immoral .\\\\nYet society has refused to recognize this in part because of the stubbornly persistent belief that work is , in its own right , some kind of reward .\\\\nThat belief , not coincidentally , also allows a small fragment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the vast majority wastes most of its year in pointless toil .\\\\nPeople buy into the pro-work ideology even though the moments people most cherish in their lives are usually those tied to pursuits that they choose on their own — whether they make money doing them or not — rather than because of tasks they are forced to perform in order to sustain life .\\\\nIt is n\\'t easy to figure out how to transition away from these assumptions .\\\\nRussell suggested that `` if the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody , and no unemployment — assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization . \\'\\'\\\\nThis did not mean that people should be encouraged to fritter away the remaining 20 hours of their work days , but rather that they should use their own judgment on how to create the best quality of life for themselves and other people .\\\\n`` Four hours \\' work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life , and that the rest of his time should be his to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \\'\\' Russell posited .\\\\nBarring that , we will continue to inhabit a world in which most of the population is miserably chugging away at pointless , menial jobs because they wrongly believe that misery is essential to survival .\\\\nAs this happens , our culture marinates in the toxic assumption `` that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else , and never for its own sake . \\'\\'\\\\nRussell was not the only great thinker to arrive at this type of conclusion .\\\\nIn his 1880 essay `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised in 1883 ) , the Marxist writer Paul Lafargue ( who was also Karl Marx \\'s son-in-law ) drew back on ancient philosophers from Greece and Rome to argue that free time , not constant work , allows us to realize our optimal selves .\\\\nLafargue believed that we flourish as human beings when we are free to think , to explore , to play , to indulge in our curiosities , to engage in stimulating conversations ... and to decide for ourselves how we can best improve the world we inhabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody on Christian ethics , strikes with its anathema the flesh of the laborer , \\'\\' Lafargue wrote .\\\\n`` Its ideal is to reduce the producer to the smallest number of needs , to suppress his joys and his passions and to condemn him to play the part of a machine turning out work without respite and without thanks . \\'\\'\\\\nHe pointed out that it is inherently hypocritical for any ethical system to claim to value freedom and then consign people to spend most of their waking hours engaged in dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation ( something even Roosevelt acknowledged ) , a right to free time ... a right , in short , to be lazy .\\\\n`` The unbridled work to which it has given itself up for the last hundred years is the most terrible scourge that has ever struck humanity , \\'\\' Lafargue concluded , hoping that one day `` work will become a mere condiment to the pleasures of idleness , a beneficial exercise to the human organism , a passion useful to the social organism only when wisely regulated and limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . \\'\\'\\\\nAuthor Mark Twain — best known for writing `` The Adventures of Tom Sawyer \\'\\' and `` The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn \\'\\' — perhaps most succinctly summed up this point when he told a reporter in 1905 that he had never `` worked \\'\\' a day in his life .\\\\n`` What I have done I have done , because it has been play .\\\\nIf it had been work I should n\\'t have done it , \\'\\' Twain mused .\\\\nThe beauty is that , when a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended to do , they wind up making the world a better place .\\\\nCertainly they contribute more to society than if they are forced to sacrifice their hours to `` bullshit jobs , \\'\\' a term that the late anthropologist David Graeber coined to refer to a special class of meaningless toil in an eponymous 2018 book .\\\\nFour years before writing that book , Graeber told Salon that he was envisioning `` a labor movement that manages to finally ditch all traces of the ideology that says that work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redefines labor as caring for other people . \\'\\'\\\\nThroughout his writings , Graeber found evidence that most people will naturally want to help others in order to keep society running .\\\\nThey do not need to be forced to work in order to survive for that to happen .\\\\nIn fact , society winds up wasting its potential for efficiency by requiring people to do that .\\\\nWe create jobs that do not need to exist , or exist solely to help extremely wealthy people engage in lives of leisure , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed to Salon back in 2014 that he was struck by how people who expressed support for the Occupy movement online ( because they were too busy working to do so in person ) made it clear that they wanted fulfilling jobs , not work for its own sake .\\\\n`` The complaints were surprisingly uniform , \\'\\' Graeber recalled .\\\\n`` Basically they were all saying , \\' I want to do something with my life that actually benefits others ; but if I go into a line of work where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so little , and they put so much in debt , that I ca n\\'t even take care of my own family !\\\\nThis is ridiculous ! \\'\\\\n\\'\\' This brings us back to Ocasio-Cortez and her `` controversial \\'\\' idea that people who are unwilling to work should n\\'t be left to die .\\\\nOnly a few weeks after she posted that , Ocasio-Cortez indirectly returned to that belief when an audience member at SXSW asked her about whether automation would ruin lives by putting people out of work .\\\\n`` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specter of being automated out of work , \\'\\' Ocasio-Cortez explained .\\\\n`` We should be excited by that .\\\\nBut the reason we \\'re not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you do n\\'t have a job , you are left to die .\\\\nAnd that is , at its core , our problem . \\'\\'\\\\nThe good news is that this problem — of meaningless work and too much work — is n\\'t unsolvable .\\\\nWhat Lafargue and Russell observed in the late 19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true today : We have the resources to create a world in which people work for fewer hours and have more free time .\\\\nWe could put a cap on how much wealth any individual or institution could accumulate , establish a universal basic income so that no one would live in poverty and have a strong centralized government to address existential crises like climate change , pandemics and chemical pollution ( an issue that gets overlooked : how plastics and other common products are making us infertile ) .\\\\nThat path seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we \\'ve been conditioned to believe that work is an absolute virtue and eliminating major class differences is unthinkable .\\\\nYet the truly radical proposition is that the vast majority of humanity should waste their lives working when they do not have to , just so a small fragment can indulge in excessive leisure because they are extremely wealthy .\\\\nIt is even more radical yet to claim that this should continue happening until , because the wealthy fail to address issues like climate change , they wind up destroying humanity altogether @\", \"Is America experiencing mass psychosis?. In 2020 , 34 percent of Republicans and independents who lean to the right surveyed by Pew Research Center agreed that it was `` probably \\'\\' or `` definitely true \\'\\' that powerful people intentionally planned the COVID-19 outbreak .\\\\nEighteen percent of Democrats and left-leaners agreed , too .\\\\nThat same year , results from a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey found that approximately three-quarters of Republicans did not trust the 2020 presidential election results .\\\\nIt should go without saying that these kinds of beliefs are fantasy , not rooted in any rational fact or evidence .\\\\nHence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiratorial beliefs and pseudoscience might characterize a vast swath of the American public as delusional .\\\\nFrom the COVID-truther movement to people believing the 2020 presidential election was rigged , it appears that the body politic is — to put it mildly — no longer on the same page .\\\\nGiven the perturbed psychological state of so many Americans , it is worth asking if something is happening — psychologically speaking — that is causing many Americans to live in very different realities .\\\\nPsychologists say yes ; and , moreover , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung .\\\\nIndeed , Jung once wrote that the demise of society would n\\'t be a physical threat , but instead mass delusion — a collective psychosis of sorts .\\\\n`` Carl Jung noted that \\'the wolf inside \\' man was far more a threat to human existence than external forces , \\'\\' Dr. Carla Marie Manly , a clinical psychologist and author of `` Joy From Fear , \\'\\' told Salon .\\\\n`` When mental forces become so toxic as to harm our overall well-being on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \\' can result . \\'\\'\\\\nIndeed , Jung himself warned that modern society was prone to collapse due to a pandemic of `` delusional ideas . \\'\\'\\\\n`` Greater than all physical dangers are the tremendous effects of delusional ideas , which are yet denied all reality by our world-blinded consciousness , \\'\\' Jung wrote .\\\\n`` Our much vaunted reason and our boundlessly overestimated will are sometimes utterly powerless in the face of \\'unreal \\' thoughts . \\'\\'\\\\nNotably , Jung believed that the United States was particularly prone to society-breaking delusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned and tested with caution , for it may very easily turn out to be only a new disease ; that is why true progress is impossible without mature judgment , \\'\\' Jung wrote .\\\\n`` The man who is unconscious of the historical context and lets slip his link with the past is in constant danger of succumbing to the crazes and delusions engendered by all novelties . \\'\\'\\\\nSome psychologists believe that this is what the country is experiencing right now — more or less .\\\\n`` Something \\'s definitely happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a painful point , you could say , \\'\\' Katharine Bainbridge , a Jungian analyst , tells Salon .\\\\nBut there are caveats .\\\\n`` It \\'s complicated , \\'\\' Bainbridge said .\\\\n`` From the left \\'s point of view , people that are n\\'t being vaccinated or think the election was rigged are psychotic , right ?\\\\nIf you \\'re on the right , you think the left is psychotic and has lost its mind in identity politics .\\\\nBoth sides look at each other and say , \\'you \\'ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsurprisingly , the concept of a `` mass psychosis \\'\\' has been seized upon by conspiracy theorists as a rationale for their conspiracies .\\\\nFor instance , anti-vaccination influencers like Joseph Mercola employ the term to suggest that those who are getting vaccinated are the real `` delusional \\'\\' ones .\\\\nBainbridge said in order to contextualize what \\'s actually happening in America through a Jungian lens , one must consider the role of a central guiding myth .\\\\n`` Jung said man can not live without religion — so you make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n\\'t not have a central myth to live by .\\\\nHe would say maybe in this time that we \\'ve lost that — we do n\\'t have a collective unifying principle . \\'\\'\\\\nCultural theorists often describe the history of human civilization as one of a transition between different central guiding myths .\\\\nIn the Western world , Christianity undergirded everyday existence and society for over a thousand years .\\\\nAfter the Renaissance , the central guiding myth became a belief in rationalism ; then , in modernity , a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all humans .\\\\nThough the phrase is often reviled , the postmodern era — which , roughly , began in the 1960s or 1970s depending on who you ask — merely means the cultural transition into an epoch into which there were no longer any fundamental guiding myths that unified human societies and drove progress .\\\\nSuch an era is , by its nature , more fractured socially ; two humans plucked at random from a postmodern epoch might find themselves believing wildly different things about human society , progress and morality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bainbridge explained , that people needed myths to live by — hence the importance of religion .\\\\nYet interestingly , there has been an ever-increasing number of Americans leaving organized religion .\\\\nIn return , many people — perhaps those who were never religious in the first place — have turned to New Age spiritual beliefs , which in some circles have curiously syncretized with the tenets of the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon .\\\\nBainbridge noted the contrast between New Age circles and QAnon in Jungian terms .\\\\n`` One is super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopian , \\'\\' Bainbridge said .\\\\n`` The problem with New Age thinking that is it leaves out the shadow — and then QAnon is obsessed with the shadow . \\'\\'\\\\n`` Unfortunately , many people were gravitating toward conspiracy theories prior to the pandemic , \\'\\' Manly observed , `` yet this trend has intensified during the pandemic due to surges in online time , anxiety , and feelings of helpless . \\'\\'\\\\nManly connected this to Jung \\'s `` wolf within \\'\\' idea .\\\\n`` Individuals and groups who perpetuate conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside \\' masses of people — often with substantial negative mental health effects . \\'\\'\\\\nBut why is this happening now ?\\\\nAs Bainbridge noted , the coronavirus pandemic appears to have amplified existing rifts .\\\\nJoe Kelly , a cult intervention specialist , also told Salon that humans are often drawn to extremism when they are suffering .\\\\n`` If an individual is hurting — financially , on any level , losing a job , having trouble with their mortgage , having trouble feeding themselves — then they \\'re more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conspiracy around them that is beyond their control , \\'\\' Kelly said .\\\\nSocial psychologists like Jung often see the government as a stand-in for authority figures like parents .\\\\nIndeed , Bainbridge said , one might analogize the draw to conspiracy theories and New Age religions as children acting out when their `` parents \\'\\' ( meaning , the state ) are not taking care of them properly .\\\\n`` If the parent is n\\'t taking care of a child , then the child acts out , right ?\\\\nThe child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its needs met , \\'\\' Bainbridge said .\\\\n`` And there are lots of people , like left-progressives , who asked : \\'How did Trump get elected ? \\'\\\\nBut once you really look into it , you \\'re like , that was obvious because there \\'s a huge part of America that \\'s in between New York and LA , and those people are fed up and they feel forgotten . \\'\\'\\\\nBainbridge says the way out of this conundrum , from a Jungian perspective , is to embrace humanism and empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , and [ ask ] , \\'what does it mean to be a human being ? \\'\\\\n\\'\\' Bainbridge said .\\\\n`` It means that you have to integrate your own darkness , wrestle with your own paradoxes and stop projecting out onto other people the opposite inside of you . \\'\\'\\\\nBainbridge added : `` There are no simple answers .\\\\nBut we have to hold on to our own humanity , instead of projecting out and demonizing other people .\\\\nThat \\'s how we survive . \\'\\'\", \"California Police Chief Requires Psych Evals For All CCW Applicants. The requirements to get a permit to carry in the state of California call for very specific things .\\\\nWell , some of the things are not that “ specific ” , otherwise the Golden State would be “ shall-issue ” rather than “ may-issue ” .\\\\nThese requirements are going to come in full focus , since Murrieta , California requires all CCW applicants to get a mental health evaluation .\\\\nYep , you read that right .\\\\nAccording to the state law , here are the requirements ( Penal .\\\\nCode , §§ 26150-26225 ) for applicants : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a license to carry a pistol , revolver , or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person , the sheriff of a county may issue a license to that person upon proof of all of the following : ( 1 ) The applicant is of good moral character .\\\\n( 2 ) Good cause exists for issuance of the license .\\\\n( 3 ) The applicant is a resident of the county or a city within the county , or the applicant ’ s principal place of employment or business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the county and the applicant spends a substantial period of time in that place of employment or business .\\\\n( 4 ) The applicant has completed a course of training as described in Section 26165 .\\\\nThe California AG ’ s website also has pretty specific instructions on the process : So , the AG is pretty mum on the situation .\\\\nDeflect and defer to someone else .\\\\nIn the city of Murrieta , California , they have listed on their website the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit .\\\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what ’ s noted above : And finally , the one line item to zero in on is part of their permitting process : Where this comes from is another section of California law ( Penal Code § 26190 ) : Basically California is the wild west when it comes to the issuance of concealed carry permits .\\\\nWe already knew that they were daft in this department , but taking a closer look at the wiggle room in the statutes , different jurisdictions really can go nuts ( no pun intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\\\nWhich brings us to the situation in Murrieta .\\\\nWhen looking through the Murrieta city ordinances , there are very few references to firearms .\\\\nMost of them are your standard firearm discharge regulations .\\\\nNothing glaring that jumps out , which means this policy on requiring a psychological review lies solely on the shoulders of the licensing authority , ie , Chief of Police .\\\\nFrom the Chief ’ s “ Murrieta Police Department Murrieta PD Policy Manual “ : Through a news tip , sources say that the Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from every candidate .\\\\nIn the application documentation online , it ’ s stated that only two psychologists are on their approved venders list .\\\\nFurther , it was said that the psychological review process requires applicants to take a personality test from one of the noted physicians .\\\\nThe test is said to be the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 ( MMPI-2 ) .\\\\nThis raises several questions .\\\\nI reached out to Chief Conrad via email and asked the following three questions , prefacing them in context of the application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) On what grounds does your department have this policy in place ?\\\\nOut of all the jurisdictions that I know of in the United States , no such permitting requirement exists .\\\\nA personality test and or psychological evaluation is subjective .\\\\nThis goes against the “ interest balancing ” approach cited in the Heller case .\\\\nMaking case-by-case determinations is forbid per the cited case for constitutional rights .\\\\nWhat are the specific requirements that would cause your department to approve or deny the issuance of a permit ?\\\\nCan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public at large know who would qualify for a permit ?\\\\n2 ) Given the Heller decision , do you think that such case-by-case determinations are constitutionally sound ?\\\\n3 ) The $ 150.00 fee is onerous for many , even in California , where the cost of living is much higher than other parts of the country .\\\\nIs this not akin to a poll tax ?\\\\nThat is a tax in order to exercise a constitutional right .\\\\nPer Harper v. Virginia , the following was stated : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard .\\\\nVoter qualifications have no relation to wealth nor to paying or not paying this or any other tax.\\\\n” Voting , and the keeping and bearing of arms , are both constitutional rights .\\\\nDo you think this is a constitutionally sound practice ?\\\\nIs the Chief within California law ?\\\\nFrom the research done , he seems to be .\\\\nBut what about the constitutionality ?\\\\nThat answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and counties in the jurisdiction of California that require mental health evaluations , yes .\\\\nDoes that make the practice right , no .\\\\nIs it within the issuing authorities discretion to require this , yes…well , it ’ s on record that at lest one individual has questioned the constitutionality of this practice directly to Chief Conrad .\\\\nWhen put to task , what does Chief Conrad think ?\\\\nI got the following reply : The people CCed in the reply to me are : This is understandable , having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop is going to be crucial here .\\\\nBecause I did check out the page the Chief referenced and it did have SOME information .\\\\nAside from the fact he completely disregarded my questions about the constitutionality of the practice , I ’ m impressed he wrote back .\\\\nJust so you know , nothing on the page cited addressed my questions about what exact results from said test would yield the non-issuance of a permit to carry .\\\\nNothing .\\\\nIt ’ s just an explanation tossed up there to justify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\\\nWhat would also have been nice is if that information was available prior to reaching out to Conrad ’ s office .\\\\nLooking at the cached information page , on Aug 25 , 2021 01:41:08 GMT the webpage he ’ s talking about was not hyperlinked .\\\\nThat cached page has already been replaced with a new cached page ( should have taken a screenshot of that one ) .\\\\nIt ’ s there now .\\\\nBut when doing my research , it was not there .\\\\nPulling some verbatim text from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in a search engine , whereas the other pages do yield results .\\\\nUsing the “ wayback machine ” , there is no record ( as of August 26th ) of the page he ’ s citing .\\\\nThe cached page referenced does have a “ wayback ” record .\\\\nHaving picked through their webpages very closely , it does appear that the Chief ’ s “ answer ” to my question was recently published online sometime on August 25th , maybe the 24th .\\\\nWhat we do know is that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was added sometime after August 25 , 2021 01:481:08 GMT : The information was hard to find because it was either not there or inaccessible .\\\\nI ’ ll note that the Chief did expeditiously respond to my email to his office ;

His opposition had something to say about the veto : The County Executive ’ s veto is ridiculous and demonstrates how out of touch he is with the people he is elected to represent , especially in Erie County where hunting is a valued tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of sportsmens ’ groups , supporters of the legislation , and families who are passionate about hunting before we proposed this law .\\\\nRight now , nearly every county in New York State has opted-in to allow this .\\\\nIt has already passed the Erie County Legislature .\\\\nThe law requires any 12 or 13-year-old to be supervised by a licensed , experienced adult .\\\\nClearly , County Executive Poloncarz did not listen to the overwhelming support laid out by those who spoke at both public hearings on the matter .\\\\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an override veto vote in the coming days .\\\\n– Erie County Republican Legislators Todaro , Lorigo , Greene , and Mills Regardless of what the majority of constituents wanted , and to heck

a child ” , should leave everyone flummoxed .\\\\nOr has so many things changed since I was 12 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that “ firearm = bad ” or “ firearm = death ” .\\\\nI ’ m surprised “ gun safety laws

halt use of AstraZeneca\\'s COVID vaccine citing clots. London — Sweden on Tuesday became the latest to join a growing list of countries to suspend use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine .\\\\nMore than a dozen nations , most of them in Europe ,

formulas currently being used in the U.S. Denmark , Iceland and Norway were among the first to halt use of the Oxford University-developed vaccine on March 11 .\\\\nThe following day , Thailand abruptly slammed the brakes on the vaccine just before it was set to be rolled out .\\\\nThat decision was reversed on Tuesday as the Thai Prime Minister got his first dose of the vaccine and urged his fellow Thais to do the same .\\\\nBulgaria , Ireland , the Netherlands , Germany , France and Spain have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine , with some saying they would wait at least until the European

there \\'s no data to suggest any link between its vaccine and any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities have backed up that stance .\\\\nThe European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization both said last week that there was no evidence the drug is causing clots .\\\\n`` An analysis of our safety data of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in any defined age group , gender , batch or in any particular country , \\'\\' an AstraZeneca spokesman said .\\\\n`` In fact , the observed number of these types of events are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be expected among the general population . \\'\\'\\\\nOfficials from the European Medicines Agency stressed last week that `` there is currently no indication that

impressive figures than with the Pfizer formula .\\\\n`` We have n\\'t had any hospitalizations or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals who were vaccinated with the vaccine , \\'\\' Pollard said .\\\\n`` So the real-world evidence confirms in real life what we saw in the clinical trials — it absolutely exceeded the expectations of the trials . \\'\\'\\\\nThe United States has stockpiled tens of millions of

Oxford shot had long been considered the front-runner candidate for inoculation programs not only in America , but around the globe .\\\\nMore than 70 countries worldwide had been using it until last week .\\\\nThe recent safety scares are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity setbacks for the vaccine .\\\\nWith trial data showing efficacy that fell short of the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines , some people in Germany and other countries were reluctant to take a `` second class \\'\\' shot .\\\\nThe government there also stalled in approving its use for people over the age of 65 , citing a lack of

.\\\\n`` It should be a much simpler process .\\\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and accessible for everyone to get their booster shot with the minimum burden and confusion , \\'\\' said Hutchinson .\\\\nOfficials in Arkansas said they had informed the Biden administration of their plans .\\\\nFederal authorities have been mulling whether to expand eligibility for booster shots nationwide ,

announcements follow two states that last week declared all of their state \\'s adult residents eligible for booster shots , ahead of the federal sign-off .\\\\nColorado and New Mexico said their

frustrated with the convoluted messaging out of the CDC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster after six months .\\\\nThe data is incredibly clear that it increases your personal protection level .\\\\nThat \\'s why my parents got it .\\\\nI got it .\\\\nMy family members got it , \\'\\' Colorado Governor Jared Polis told `` Face the Nation \\'\\' on Sunday .\\\\nA CDC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment specifically on the move , saying only that providers `` should administer vaccine in accordance \\'\\' with the current FDA emergency use authorization and CDC provider agreement .\\\\nAsked about the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doling out booster shots to all adults , authorities in New Mexico said their move `` trumps CDC guidance \\'\\' for providers in the state .\\\\n`` Vaccinators are protected , \\'\\' said Matt Bieber , a spokesperson for New Mexico \\'s Department of Health .\\\\nOther jurisdictions have also looked for different avenues to broaden access to booster shots , with New York City announcing on Monday that it was ordering providers not to turn away any adults looking for booster shots .\\\\nWhile providers are generally allowed to prescribe medicines `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the FDA on the private market , the CDC has previously warned vaccine providers that they could face penalties , lose pandemic liability protections , and may not be reimbursed for shots if they defied the agency \\'s recommendations governing use of the government-purchased COVID-19 vaccine .\\\\nHowever , the CDC has also long urged jurisdictions to remove hurdles for vaccinations , allowing adults to `` self-attest \\'\\' whether they were eligible .\\\\nGovernors in West Virginia and New Jersey on Monday also urged adult residents to get booster shots , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for the third doses .\\\\nUltimately New York City \\'s order , like California \\'s guidance last week , may amount to codifying a vaccination policy that had been relying largely on the honor system .\\\\n`` The state \\'s guidance on boosters is in alignment with the CDC .\\\\nIt is simplified to help empower more Californians to get a booster .\\\\nCalifornia has

As COVID-19 infections surge in Arizona schools , sickening thousands of students and staff and forcing thousands more into quarantine , parents — and the public at large — have been left without a

Maricopa counties .\\\\nPima alone pinpoints where outbreaks are occurring ; Maricopa County reports only numbers of active and resolved school outbreaks .\\\\nIn counties without comprehensive school-outbreak dashboards , the decision to publicize school-level case and quarantine data is left to individual districts .\\\\nThe Arizona Department of Education said in a statement that it “ has urged all public schools to communicate transparently about school-related outbreaks with staff , students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .\\\\n“ Now , as cases , particularly in children , are rapidly increasing , families need the best information possible to stay safe and slow the spread of the virus , ” ADE spokesperson Morgan Dick wrote in an email .\\\\n“ ADE recognizes this can be incredibly

able to operate and provide in-person instruction.\\\\n” While school officials don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases or exposures , they do have to alert parents if their child was in close contact with a known

effect until Sept. 29 — assuming a pending lawsuit seeking to block it does not succeed — the majority of school districts in the state have opted not to mandate face coverings .\\\\nMore than 30

Around 60 % of people can ’ t go 10 minutes without lying .\\\\nThat ’ s a whole lot of lies .\\\\nStill , there are a few things we can do to see if someone ’ s lying or not , like look at their smile , for example .\\\\nIf it looks forced , they could very well be lying .\\\\nWe at Bright Side have gathered a few tricks to help you find out who ’ s lying and who ’ s not .\\\\n1 .\\\\nAsk them to tell you the story again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie , they already have a made-up story ready to go in chronological order .\\\\nIf they have to tell it in reverse , they ’ ll feel stressed because it ’ s not what they practiced .\\\\nThis means that lying will become a much more difficult task .\\\\nThey ’ ll start to leave out details , and cracks will open in the story as they become more nervous .\\\\nA true story will be much easier to tell , and when you do it backward , you might even remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time around .\\\\n2 .\\\\nUse the element of surprise .\\\\nIf you think there ’ s a chance a person is lying , throw a random question in the middle of their story .\\\\nAsk them something really specific if you can .\\\\nThis way , they will have to expand their lie so much that they actually trap themselves .\\\\n3 .\\\\nCheck to see if their story is vague .\\\\nA liar might leave out important details simply because they have no idea of how to include them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague the story really is .\\\\nIt might be on purpose to prevent you from asking specific questions they don ’ t have the answers to .\\\\n4 .\\\\nLook out for fake smiles .\\\\nWhen lying , there ’ s a higher chance the person will press their lips together .\\\\nThis will make their smile look fake .\\\\nIf you know the person already , spotting a fake smile might be easier .\\\\nBut here ’ s a tip : When people smile , they usually do it with their whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 .\\\\nAsk them the same question in different ways .\\\\nA liar will often just answer with the same details but will say them differently .\\\\nWhen you ask a question in , say , 3 different ways , it ’ ll force the person to give more info about the story that they ’ re telling .\\\\nIf they ’ re lying , they ’ ll get stuck using the same words , phrases , and even details .\\\\n6 .\\\\nTry to pay attention to any voice changes .\\\\nOne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tone of their voice and the speed at which they speak .\\\\nIf you notice they ’ re speaking faster or even slower , chances are they ’ re trying to keep up with the lies they ’ re telling you .\\\\nThe same goes for how high or low their voices go .\\\\nAll of this shows uncertainty .\\\\n7 .\\\\nCheck if there ’ s a delay in their answers .\\\\nIf you ask a question that ’ s relatively easy to answer , yet the person is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it probably means they ’ re either thinking about what to say or trying to keep up with their own lies .\\\\nIf they jump the gun , it ’ s not a good sign either .\\\\nThis can mean they had an answer ready for you on the tip of their tongue .\\\\n8 .\\\\nCheck if there ’ s a change in their confidence .\\\\nChances are , if the person who ’ s lying feels in charge of the conversation , they will look very confident in your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in their own lies , they ’ ll start losing control , and that confidence will also vanish .\\\\nThey ’ ll begin to close themselves up more and more .\\\\n9 .\\\\nAs a last resort , call them out on their lies .\\\\nIf you think nothing else is working , provide them with the facts you already know and call them out on their own lies .\\\\nIf someone keeps blatantly lying , like by adding too many details that you think are suspicious , you can try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use the right facts , otherwise , you might be called a liar yourself .\", \"These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Be Most Affected By Aries Season.

In a 1997 episode of `` Seinfeld , \\'\\' a character named Kurt learns to his dismay that he is going bald .\\\\nHis dismay does n\\'t stem from his aversion to being hairless ; in fact , he is a swimmer , and is used to shaving his cranium to better compete .\\\\nBut when he learns that he may become involuntarily bald , he sinks into a state of impulsivity and depression .\\\\nWhile most bald people do not react as poorly as the `` Seinfeld \\'\\' swimmer , the episode does accurately capture a basic truth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not simply that men are self-conscious , but that male pattern baldness imparts a feeling of disempowerment over their appearance .\\\\n`` Male pattern baldness or Androgenetic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss , affecting up to 80 % of men in their lifetime , \\'\\' Dr. Kristen Lo Sicco , an associate professor of dermatology at NYU Langone Health , told Salon by email .\\\\n`` About 75 % of people with Androgenetic alopecia have at least one family member with this type of hair loss . \\'\\'\\\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery of baldness , and the lack of control over it .\\\\nIt is distressing for any human to feel that one \\'s body is out of one \\'s control , that it is doing things without our consent .\\\\nYet science has a sense of why , and how , baldness happens — and why men ( and sometimes women ) lose power over their hair .\\\\nThere is , apparently , a connection between a chemical that we associate with masculinity — testosterone — and the looming threat that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who suffers from male pattern baldness has hair follicles that sensitive to the testosterone metabolite , or dehydrotestosterone .\\\\nLike the color of your eyes or shape of your earlobe , the structure of your hairline is actually quite individual and says a great deal about you .\\\\nUntil recently , scientists did n\\'t have a particularly comprehensive knowledge about different types of hairlines .\\\\nThat \\'s because early major classification systems tended to mostly or entirely study only one race ( Caucasian men , Japanese men ) .\\\\nIn 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. O\\'Tar Norwood studied male pattern baldness in over 1,000 males and came up with the system most commonly used today .\\\\nAccording to Norwood \\'s system , most hair loss begins at the temples and gradually recedes back , eventually leaving a peninsula of hair in the middle of the scalp .\\\\nIf the baldness continues , that peninsula will become more narrow while the hair on the crown starts to thin out .\\\\nIf your baldness insists on defoliating your cranium even further , the peninsula will start to shrink the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown .\\\\nWhen the two areas of baldness finally meet , you will be left with nothing but a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair .\\\\nThere is one variant to this system , which Norwood dubbed `` Type A . \\'\\'\\\\nIts main features are that it deprives the early balding man of that precious peninsula but spares him that initial thinning on the crown .\\\\nInstead , like a retreating army destined to be court marshaled for abandoning their position , the hair at the front simply gives up the fight and allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape atop one \\'s skull .\\\\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox ?\\\\nSubscribe to Salon \\'s weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist .\\\\nAnalogies aside , there are straightforward scientific explanations for why one \\'s hair seems to abandon you .\\\\nThe truth is that , with male pattern baldness , the hair is n\\'t falling off of your head in unusually large quantities .\\\\n( Hair is supposed to fall out , after all . )\\\\nIt is rather that the hair does n\\'t grow back as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to cause the appearance of balding , \\'\\' Lo Sicco explained .\\\\nThe first is called `` miniaturization .\\\\n`` This means the hair shafts are becoming smaller and smaller in caliber ( thickness ) over time , \\'\\' Lo Sicco continued .\\\\nThe second is `` shortening of the growth phase of hair , \\'\\' known as `` the anagen phase . \\'\\'\\\\n`` This means less hair will be on the scalp and will become shorter , \\'\\' Lo Sicco said .\\\\n`` This is because the length of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anagen phase . \\'\\'\\\\nThe type of hairline that you wind up with depends on how your biological chemistry impacts the hair follicles at different locations on your head .\\\\nLikewise , it turns out there is also a reason that bald men continue growing hair on the back and sides of their head — the `` horseshoe \\'\\' pattern of hair , as sported by celebrities like Larry David and the late James Gandolfini .\\\\n`` The hair on the top and front of the scalp is susceptible to androgens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not ( occipital scalp ) , \\'\\' Lo Sicco wrote .\\\\n`` This theory is known as \\'donor dominance , \\' pioneered by Dr. Orentreich who developed hair transplantation in the US while at the NYU Skin & Cancer Unit . \\'\\'\\\\nWhile it is easy to joke about male pattern baldness , it is not a harmless medical condition .\\\\nDepending on the stage and severity , baldness has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease ( although the extent of that risk is still debated ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate cancer .\\\\nThe exact mechanisms are unknown , however , as much still remains to be learned about the exact mechanisms behind baldness .\", \"Climate change is a huge threat, so why isn\\'t everyone talking about it?.

BlackLivesMatter days , a glance at newspaper reports , both on and off the continent , would reveal that the intrinsic corruption of the African is nonetheless a widely held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the post-colonial state : how the west invented African corruption , racism scholar Gabriel Apata notes , that while corruption is universal , “ when it comes to Africa , [ corruption ] has remained a permanent black mark that will not shift , an idea that encapsulates the African predicament in all its various shades and manifestations ” .\\\\nHe shows how media descriptions of it often present it as a form of pathology : “ a cancer , virus , epidemic , cankerworm and so forth , these descriptions evoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV-AIDS whose origins lie in Africa … Nowhere else or about no other continent is corruption described in these terms.\\\\n” This is despite the fact that African scholars have long traced the roots of corruption to colonialism .\\\\nAs Kenyan author Joe Khamisi notes in his book Looters and Grabbers : 54 Years of Corruption and Plunder by the Elite 1963-2017 , the role of colonialism in establishing corruption practices has not stopped attempts to portray them as a legacy of the pre-colonial past – including as a consequence of a wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out gifts to “ chiefs ” who , ironically , are themselves another colonial invention .\\\\nSuch attempts to indigenise graft follow the path of other invented and supposedly “ African ” realities such as the “ tribe ” .\\\\nAs Apata points out , the corruption prototype “ emerged out of Western neo-liberal capitalist tradition and its exploitative tendencies , a system that was exported to Africa and which in turn became Africanised ” .\\\\nIn this sense , the corruption found especially in “ Black Africa ” is presented as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlightened practices of the “ developed ” West .\\\\nSo while they may both have corrupt officials who abuse their power to rip off their citizens , the corrupt European politician is presented as a societal aberration , a negation of its wholesome values , while the corrupt African official is taken as the embodiment of African values .\\\\nThis racialised approach is also reflected in the different language used to describe practices that look very similar .\\\\nMPs in the UK are paid by companies to “ lobby ” for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ high-priority lane ” .\\\\nWhen much the same thing happens in Kenya , MPs are said to have received “ bribes ” and money is “ funnelled ” into the pockets of their corrupt benefactors in the private sector .\\\\nWhen public officials steal money from Africans , their countries quickly earn themselves the unhappy distinction of being “ corrupt ” .\\\\nYet when the same money is hidden , as revealed by the Pandora Papers , in Western tax havens , with the help of Western consultants , firms and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\\\n“ It has caused me the greatest trouble , and forever causes me the greatest trouble , to perceive that unspeakably more depends upon what things are called , than on what they are , ” wrote German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche .\\\\nThis is undoubtedly true of the Western worldview regarding corruption .\\\\nThe attempt to essentialise and exoticise “ African corruption ” only serves to obscure its real roots and to sanitise the same behaviour in the West .\\\\nAnd as Nietzsche went on to note , “ the appearance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence in the end , and operates as the essence ” .\\\\nThe views expressed in this article are the author ’ s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera ’ s editorial stance .\", \"Bloomberg: White-Collar Visa Workers Take 2/3 of New Tech Jobs Each Year. Two-thirds of entry-level tech jobs go to compliant foreign guest-workers , not to the young American professionals who may create a new wave of establishment-shaking companies , according to a report from Bloomberg .\\\\nIn 2018 , “ the U.S. had between 96,000 and 143,000 openings in IT occupa\\xadtions that typically went to candidates with a bachelor ’ s degree or higher in computer science or engineering , ” said the March 10 report , headlined “ STEM Graduates Deserve a Better Path to Good Jobs.\\\\n” But the government each year provides “ Occupational Practical Training ” ( OPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreigners who have paid tuition to American universities .\\\\nIt also invites roughly 85,000 foreign graduates on H-1B work visas , the report says .\\\\n“ So , OPT participants accounted for anywhere from one-third to one-half of new hires .\\\\nIf you add H-1B candidates , up to two-thirds of openings went to guest workers , ” said the report , which relies heavily on Hal Salzman , an expert on high-tech employment at Rutgers University .\\\\nFew of the OPT workers are high-skilled , Bloomberg acknowledged : “ More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s degrees awarded in 2018 came from unranked programs , or those ranked 50 and lower by U.S. News and World Report .\\\\nJust 17 % came from schools ranked in the top 25 .\\\\n[ universities ] ” Breitbart News has extensively reported on the fraud-ridden OPT program — and its sister program , the Curricular Practical Training program — which provides Fortune 500 companies with roughly 400,000 cheap foreign workers each year .\\\\nThe OPTs — and the many similar H-1B , L-12 , J-1 , and TN visa workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs in a wide variety of industry sectors , including tech , healthcare , academia , accounting , and design .\\\\nFew of the OPT workers complain about their lower-wage jobs because their CEOs can fire them at will .\\\\nMore importantly , the foreign OPT workers accept the low wages and long hours in exchange for the promise of green cards .\\\\nThis means that employers can pay foreign graduates with government-supplied free green cards — in contrast them paying American graduates with dollars subtracted from company profits , stock values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 1 million foreigners are working in lower-wage , white-collar jobs in the hope of getting green cards .\\\\nThis huge “ Green Card Workforce ” helps lower many Americans ’ salaries , diminish the importance of professional advice in business , and smother the future creation of innovative companies by experience and outspoken American graduates .\\\\nJay Palmer closely monitors this layered hiring system in his role as a human rights advocate for migrants , visa workers , and trafficked workers .\\\\nU.S. college graduates owe so much in student loans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 45,000 or $ 50,000 , but the OPT worker “ will come out and work for $ 30,000 because of the poverty levels back in their home country , ” he told Breitbart News , adding : They ’ ll work for 30 percent to 40 percent less than Americans can work and drive American salaries down and drive the [ U.S. ] college students out of work .\\\\nThe [ OPTs ] will live very cheaply , sometimes five and seven and eight to a house .\\\\nThey will send their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , India , Slovenia , Croatia , or China or Vietnam , Venezuela , or other countries .\\\\nSo it is not helping the economy because they ’ re not spending money here .. tax receipts decline , municipalities lose out .\\\\nAnd the [ employers ] are paying them on 1099s .\\\\nThe majority of them on 1099s never file their taxes .\\\\nThis is a huge scheme that I know that the State Department and Department of Labor is looking at .\\\\nThe Fortune 500 companies have their master services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they ’ re not liable for this .\\\\nIf a company hires an American college graduate , the company has to pay employment tax , unemployment tax , Social Security taxes , pay their health care , all of the normal benefits .\\\\nBut if they hire an OPT worker , they ’ re hiring them through a third-party contractor , paying them on 1099s , without benefits or taxes .\\\\nSo their rate of return [ per employee ] is about 80 percent higher .\\\\nThey save up to 28 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the [ subcontractor hourly ] rates are lower .\\\\nIf the rate [ paid by the Fortune 500 company to the subcontractor ] is $ 50 an hour [ per graduate ] , the workers probably end up maybe getting $ 20 an hour , and the subcontractors pocket the difference .\\\\nThat scheme is known as the layer system .\\\\nPalmer works with the Weiser Law Firm in Pennsylvania .\\\\nOver time , the mass of foreign tech workers are getting a greater share of careers — and wealth — from CEOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many American graduates into lesser jobs .\\\\nMedia interviews spotlight the foreign graduates ’ sense of entitlement to Americans ’ jobs .\\\\nCNBC reported February 19 : Shantanu , 33 , received his Ph.D. in structural biology from the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , in December .\\\\nHis OPT application arrived on Nov. 17 and he didn ’ t receive a filing receipt until Feb. 11 .\\\\nHe ’ s still waiting for work authorization and is unable to start his postdoctoral fellowship at Northwestern University ’ s Feinberg School of Medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time coming to the U.S. , working in the U.S. and contributing to the U.S. , ” said Shantanu , who asked to be identified only by his first name .\\\\n“ And after a while , when we are treated like this , it makes us wonder why we chose the U.S. in the first place.\\\\n” The Bloomberg article includes a few proposed reforms to the OPT program , but those reforms would not significantly reduce the number of American graduates who get sidelined by CEOs who prefer to pay compliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shifting oversight from DHS to the Labor Department should be an obvious baseline , according to Daniel Costa of the Economic Policy Institute and Ronil Hira of Howard University … Costa and [ Ronil ] Hira have sensibly proposed that foreign students should be “ paid according to U.S. wage standards.\\\\n” Eliminating the payroll tax advantage would also help ensure that merit rather than pay drives hiring … A carrot-and-stick approach , for example , could exempt employers from such taxes for two years when they hire new U.S .\\\\nSTEM graduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for displacement when an OPT student is hired .\\\\nFinally , the U.S. should focus on attracting talent for jobs where a shortage truly exists .\\\\nThis involves ensuring visa holders have a legitimate job offer with a wage at or above specified levels , making a concerted effort to recruit U.S. workers and targeting the truly “ best and brightest.\\\\n” President Donald Trump missed the opportunity to make himself a champion for white-collar workers in the 2020 election , largely because a few of his top aides simply favored the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But according to Bloomberg , Biden may grab the political prize by forcing pro-employee changes to the visa-worker programs : “ His personal grief has become a

Note : The author of this piece served in the Department of Education during the Trump administration and was part of the team that announced the 2020 Title IX rule .\\\\nThe Biden administration is making incremental progress at undoing the Trump-era Title IX rule , which advanced protections for students and attracted the ire of Left-wing interest groups .\\\\nTitle IX is the law , enacted in 1972 , that prohibits any educational program that receives federal funding from discriminating on the basis of sex .\\\\nTitle IX requires colleges to ensure that their male and female students have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of gender , and it mandates that colleges have a process for addressing complaints of sexual misconduct .\\\\nDuring the Obama years , the Department of Education sought to advance its Title IX agenda through a document called a `` Dear Colleague Letter . \\'\\'\\\\nGovernment agencies use Dear Colleague Letters to call attention to a policy issue and to make recommendations ; these letters are not legally binding .\\\\nOn April 4 , 2011 , the Department of Education ’ s Office for Civil Rights issued a Dear Colleague Letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding .\\\\nThe letter stated that schools “ must use a preponderance of the evidence standard ” to adjudicate Title IX complaints .\\\\nThe preponderance of the evidence standard is satisfied when “ it is more likely than not that sexual harassment or violence occurred.\\\\n” It is a lower standard that “ clear and convincing , ” and much lower than “ beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\\n” The letter also strongly recommended that colleges keep their Title IX processes under 60 calendar days .\\\\nIt also told schools not to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , “ A school should not delay conducting its own investigation or taking steps to protect the complainant because it wants to see whether the alleged perpetrator will be found guilty of a crime.\\\\n” In 2014 , the head of the Office for Civil Rights told college administrators that she would pull federal funding from any college found repeatedly going against the recommendations of the Dear Colleague Letter , as reported by the Huffington Post .\\\\nCatherine Lhamon , who was appointed to the position by then-President Obama in 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May to serve in the same post .\\\\nDue process violations proliferated under the Dear Colleague Letter .\\\\nA study published in 2020 in the New York University Journal of Legislation and Public Policy found that , since the publication of the Dear Colleague Letter , 151 accused students had sued their schools and won because their schools were found to have violated their legal rights .\\\\nTo remedy this , then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the Dear Colleague Letter in Sept. 2017 .\\\\nIn Nov. 2018 , she set in motion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule that would carry the force of law .\\\\nThe final rule , which was published in May 2020 and took effect in August of the same year , codified into law that both the accused student and the accuser must have the opportunity to examine the evidence against them and must answer questions in a live hearing .\\\\nThe rule requires colleges and universities to protect survivors by offering them supports , such as class schedule changes or new dorm assignments , at no cost to the student .\\\\nUnlike in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letter , colleges can now choose to use either the “ clear and convincing ” or the “ preponderance of the evidence ” standard , so long as they use one standard consistently across all Title IX procedures .\\\\nThe left has accused it of being too friendly to accused students .\\\\nJust shy of one month after the rule ’ s publication , 17 states and the District of Columbia sued to overturn it and filed a motion for injunction , which would have temporarily stopped the rule from taking effect .\\\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injunction in August , just over a week before the rule took effect

Biden Administration will restore the Title IX guidance for colleges , including the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter , which outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IX proceedings.\\\\n” On March 8 , Biden issued an executive order directing Sec .\\\\nCardona to “ review all existing regulations , orders , guidance documents , policies , and any other similar agency actions ” pertaining to Title IX .\\\\nOn April

The Joffrey Ballet ’ s magnificently reimagined “ Nutcracker ” is only six years old , and last year the grand ballet didn ’ t happen at all .\\\\nNo wonder it seems like giddy victory at the Lyric Opera House , where Christopher Wheeldon ’ s 2016 production , a celebration of Chicago ’ s audacious spirit in the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire , has been so neatly re-fitted that it seems yet again new .\\\\nBathed in gilding of the freshly refurbished Lyric Opera House , and awash with the Russian romanticism of Tchaikovsky ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joffrey by the Lyric Opera Orchestra , there is a fairy-tale quality to this uniquely Chicago version of an adolescent girl ’ s fantasy that her wooden nutcracker comes to life as the prince of her dreams .\\\\nThe girl , known as Clara in the Tchaikovsky original , is now Marie .\\\\nShe lives with her brother and their widowed mother among fellow worker families in a neighborhood of shacks at the foot of a project rising behind them — the 1893 Columbian Exposition .\\\\nTchaikovsky ’ s sparkling ballet is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , but in this twist , the only touch of gold we see is in the hands of the girl ’ s mother , a sculptress shaping what looks like a model of the Fair ’ s iconic statue .\\\\nThe guests are the mother ’ s skilled but poor laborer friends , gathering to celebrate the holiday in her humble abode , and this is where an impressive visitor arrives to bestow gifts , including a nutcracker for Marie , whose romantic dream constitutes the rest of this tale .\\\\nGiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future historians will call the current era , a fairy tale seems just right in this time .\\\\nThis year the company undertook an ambitious schedule of 24 performances , rotating among popular stars on its roster and putting in many first-time opportunities for children and young dancers .\\\\nIn all , it feels like a spontaneous party , but that belies the many intricate adjustments to make this move to the Lyric .\\\\nScenery was re-spaced onstage , because the depth is different than it had been at the Auditorium .\\\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery , adjusting some dancer positions , adding a few steps to reach certain spots , and making other minor differences in the complex mix , according to production director Cody Chen .\\\\nThe audience experience , which was looking downward into a fishbowl setting at the Auditorium , is also different , especially from the main floor .\\\\nThe stage seems straight ahead , or slightly higher , in the opera house seats , requiring additional subtle adjustments that the performers had to practice .\\\\nThe Lyric set aside two rehearsal spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers to move around at one time , and special temporary flooring made of wood planks with foam cushioning , crucial to protect dancers ’ muscle and bone , was also set in place onstage for the duration .\\\\nThe “ Nutcracker ” is by far the largest production of the Joffrey season , involving more than 80 dancers in rotation , including young children , always some of them dancing with the company for the first time ever .\\\\nIt ’ s also always the first time for some of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who must help to manage intricate tricks like the morphing of the little Christmas tree , which grows to an enormous height in Clara ’ s magical and intricate dream .\\\\nThe evening production that I saw , on the first day of the run Dec. 4 , featured the lovely Amanda Assucena as Marie , the passionate child and graceful dreamer whose imaginary adventure becomes a fight to help save her nutcracker .\\\\nHer beloved new toy is magically transformed into her dream-state prince — the exceptional José Pablo Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suddenly very life-size and highly entertaining soldier rats .\\\\nWith Marie ’ s help , the soldiers save the day , setting the stage for a magical second act in which Marie and her prince sit in a World ’ s Fair-style gondola straight out of the Chicago picture books , to witnesses a parade of set pieces that , in this production , represent the various exotic pavilions in the exposition .\\\\n.\\\\nIn that second act , the surpassingly exotic elegance of Jeraldine Mendoza and Dylan Gutierrez as the Arabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the quartet of Spanish Dancers , Xavier Núñez in his solo Chinese Dance , and a riotous Buffalo Bill ’ s Wild West Show transformation of what was once Tchaikovsky ’ s Russian Dance were just as delightful .\\\\nChristopher Wheeldon ’ s deeply moving and highly original production has landed on an ideal stage .\\\\nIt should serve this “ Nutcracker ” well for years to come .\", \"Baltimore Gun Control Activist Killed While Visiting Housing Project.

McALLEN , Texas — Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) led several Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee on a two-day visit to McAllen this week where they witnessed the ongoing border crisis , and all the members — as they recapped their visit — said the Biden administration was at fault for surging numbers of illegal migrants .\\\\nBorder Patrol agents apprehended nearly 170,000 migrants crossing the southern border illegally in March , a 72 percent increase from February .\\\\nAs Breitbart News reported , in the first two full months of President Joe Biden ’ s time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprehensions were at a combined total of nearly 210,000 , while in the last four months of former President Donald Trump ’ s tenure , apprehensions were at a combined total of just over 280,000 .\\\\nJordan , the ranking Republican member on the Judiciary Committee , gathered from speaking with Border Patrol agents that the Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols ( MPP ) program , also known as Remain in Mexico — which Biden ’ s Department of Homeland Security suspended on his first day as president — is imperative to reinstate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influx .\\\\nJordan told Breitbart News on Wednesday near the conclusion of his visit , “ This is … not just Jim Jordan talking , not just Republican members of the Judiciary Committee talking .\\\\nThis is the Border Patrol agents themselves , what they ’ re telling us .\\\\nThat ’ s what we ’ ve got to get done , and we have to talk about this and try to persuade our Democratic colleagues this is just good common sense .\\\\nThis is for the good of the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of these kids and these families who are making that treacherous trek up through Mexico to get here.\\\\n” The MPP program allowed border officials to return asylum-seeking migrants back to Mexico while they await the processing of their claims , which the Trump administration at the time of implementing the program , in January 2019 , said would serve as a deterrent for illegal migration and help control an “ unprecedented number ” of “ fraudulent asylum claims.\\\\n” Opponents of the MPP program argue sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creates nearly insurmountable barriers to being granted asylum if they do actually qualify for it .\\\\nHowever , as Rep. Andy Biggs ( R-AZ ) detailed during a roundtable the delegation attended Wednesday , halting the MPP program has served as one cause — among several other Biden policies — of what has now become America ’ s “ massive humanitarian crisis.\\\\n” “ We know that it ’ s policy driven , ” Biggs said .\\\\n“ We know that it ’ s this Biden administration ’ s policies that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ?\\\\nBecause we simply have to look at when those policies were in place .\\\\nI ’ m talking MPP , the Remain in Mexico policy .\\\\nI ’ m talking about the agreements with the Northern Triangle states , with Guatemala , El Salvador , and Honduras .\\\\nI ’ m talking about the incentive factor .\\\\nWe all respond to incentives .\\\\nHow about $ 1,400 per illegal alien in the COVID relief package ?\\\\nHow about a free education ?\\\\nHow about , you ’ ll get transported wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ’ re in , it ’ s almost impossible for you to be sent out , and that ’ s really what ’ s going on .\\\\nAnd so , President Trump found a problem , and he solved it .\\\\nPresident Biden saw a solution and now he ’ s dissolved that and created a massive humanitarian crisis.\\\\n” Biggs , at a press conference later on Wednesday , referred to comments Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador made : “ That ’ s why the president of Mexico said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Biden ’ s mess.\\\\n” Rep. Dan Bishop ( R-NC ) , who also attended the trip , agreed asylum claims are a “ predicate for people entering the country.\\\\n” He told Breitbart News of the MPP program , “ It was an innovative , strategic policy to eliminate the perverse incentive in asylum claims .\\\\nThey can assert their asylum right , but you don ’ t want as the price of that to have any unlimited numbers of people coming into the country.\\\\n” The House Judiciary Committee is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration policy .\\\\nJordan said at the press conference the committee ’ s Democrat members were invited on the trip and declined the invitation .\\\\nBreitbart News reached out to committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler ( D-NY ) to inquire about the reason for this and did not receive an immediate response .\\\\nRep.

Team Blue can ’ t hide the decline even in their own polling .\\\\nAlthough , laughably , they insist they ’ ve gained ground on Republicans over the past few months .\\\\nMore on that in a second .\\\\nThe two parties agree on almost nothing these days but they agree that American voters are more inclined to elect Republicans to Congress than Democrats at the moment .\\\\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee ’ s internal polling this month showed that Republicans in battleground districts had improved by seven percentage points since the beginning of the year .\\\\nSo-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Democrats ; now they are ahead by four points .\\\\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ’ s generic ballot testing this month also shows Democrats trailing — albeit by two points .\\\\nParty officials said that actually was an improvement from some other recent months .\\\\nThe D.C.C.C .\\\\ndeclined to say what its polling showed at the start of the year… Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota , who is chairman of the House Republican campaign arm , said in an interview that the N.R.C.C.\\\\n’ s private polling at the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval rating as 10 percentage points higher than his disapproval rating .\\\\nNow , Emmer said , it ’ s the reverse : Biden ’ s disapproval is 10 points higher .\\\\nThe DCCC would have us believe that their party trailed Republicans by *six* points on the generic ballot in July and have since clawed four of those points back .\\\\nFun fact : Joe Biden was rocking a 52/43 job approval in mid-July .\\\\nThere ’ d been no major summer wave of COVID .\\\\nInflation had yet to strike real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Afghan government was still in charge in Kabul and an orderly U.S. withdrawal was on track .\\\\nThe RCP average of generic ballot polling at the time had Dems up by more than five points in the first half of the month : Since then , Afghanistan has gone sideways , the Delta variant ravaged the American southeast , and the country endured the worst month of inflation in 30 years .\\\\nAnd the DCCC would have us believe that they ’ ve gained ground on Republicans over that period .\\\\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Virginia election wasn ’ t held in July , I guess .\\\\nMaybe he would have won by 10 points instead of two .\\\\nIf you want a sense of how bad it actually looks out there for Democrats , consult this new poll by Republican groups about four longtime blue-leaning districts in Colorado , Indiana , Oregon , and Texas .\\\\nOne of those districts hasn ’ t elected a Republican in nearly a century .\\\\nAnd yet : Polling commissioned by GOP groups on four newly redistricted , Democratic-leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District , Indiana ’ s 1st District , Oregon ’ s 5th District and Texas ’ 28th District — found President Joe Biden ’ s approval ratings underwater in areas he won by an average of 7 points in 2020 .\\\\nThe generic ballot in those combined districts , pitting an unnamed Democratic candidate against an unnamed Republican candidate , was tied at 39 percent among registered voters .\\\\nAcross all four districts , 27 percent said the country was on the right track , while 67 percent said it was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39/39 in Biden +7 districts , you can guess what it ’ s like in districts where Dems barely held on last fall .\\\\nThe Times tried to figure out how far to the right nationally voters have truly swung over the past few months .\\\\nThe results in Virginia and New Jersey suggest a consistent swing of 12 points towards the Republicans , a terrifying prospect for Dems in the midterms , although it could be as little as three points per some polling .\\\\nBut if Biden ’ s decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is any indication , it ’ s probably seven points at least — even in places otherwise inclined to vote blue .\\\\nHoo boy .\\\\nIt ’ s possible that Build Back Better will prove phenomenally popular among the public and rescue the Democrats next fall .\\\\nBut I wouldn ’ t bet on it .\\\\nNew national polling from Echelon Insights : In the four swing districts polled by Republican groups , support for Build Back Better stood at 41/52 .\\\\nWhether that ’ s because progressives in those districts view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view it as too large is unclear — possibly both — but Democrats obviously have a problem .\\\\nTheir $ 1.85 trillion life preserver might not be buoyant .\\\\nOne more result from Echelon : The only bright spot for Democrats in their survey is that Biden still polls evenly with Trump at 45 apiece .\\\\nThat ’ s down sharply from April , when he led Trump by 10 , but it ’ s a testament to Trump ’ s weakness as a candidate that things could go sideways for Dems on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pulling no more than 45 percent against a president struggling with the worst inflation crisis in decades .\\\\nIf Republicans nominate DeSantis in 2024 , I think they win going away .\\\\nIf they nominate Trump , coin flip .\"]}, \"26\": {\"terms\": [\"said\", \"cent\", \"year\", \"china\", \"uk\", \"new\", \"government\", \"climate\", \"000\", \"state\", \"pandemic\", \"company\",

will trigger an overhaul of the GOP \\'s messaging , further solidifying it as the party of Mr. Trump .\\\\nThe House Republican Conference is simply the organizational body for all the GOP members in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair is responsible for scheduling meetings where members can discuss issues and legislation within their own party .\\\\nBut the chair also has a major role in party messaging , both coordinating media availabilities and interviews with members and speaking on behalf of the caucus .\\\\nThe job gives Cheney the third-highest position among House Republicans , behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise .\\\\nHowever , conference chairs have seldom reached higher positions within the party .\\\\nWhy is Cheney \\'s leadership post at risk ?\\\\nCheney is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair because she has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump and rejected his unfounded theories about the election , while other members of House GOP leadership and some members have stood behind the former president and his claims .\\\\nShe began publicly breaking with McCarthy over how the party should handle Trump after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol January 6 .\\\\nShe called for Trump to be impeached for his role in the event and later voted to impeach him , while McCarthy urged members to move forward .\\\\nFor her impeachment vote , Cheney @ @ @ @ @ @

assignments for promoting conspiracy theories and apparently endorsing violence toward Democratic politicians .\\\\nIn both cases , the conference voted overwhelmingly not to take action .\\\\nJust 61 Republicans voted to remove Cheney from her post , while 145 voted for her to stay in the vote by secret ballot .\\\\nBut days later , the GOP in Cheney \\'s home state of Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to

secret ballot or by voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was the previous one , according to two sources familiar with the process .\\\\nBecause there are 218 Republican members in the House , at least 110 would need to vote against Cheney to remove her .\\\\nIf the attempt to oust her is successful , the conference would then need to elect a replacement chair .\\\\nThat election would likely take place at a

Thom Tillis , who won a second term in 2020 , voted not guilty Saturday in the impeachment trial .\\\\nBut , in a post-trial statement outlining his vote , Tillis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as being declared innocent .\\\\nPresident Trump is most certainly not the victim here ; his words and actions were reckless and he shares responsibility for the disgrace that occurred on January 6.\\\\n” Tillis defended Burr , his fellow North Carolina Republican senator , and his guilty vote .\\\\n“ Richard Burr is a great friend and a great senator who has a distinguished record of serving the people of North Carolina , ” Tillis in a statement when asked about the censure .\\\\n“ He voted his conscience.\\\\n” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and level of support , demonstrated just how much influence Trump — who carried North Carolina in 2016 and 2020 — holds over the party even after his electoral loss .\\\\nHis support could be critical in the open 2022 Republican primary to replace Burr , who announced during the 2016 campaign that he would not run again .\\\\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , a close ally of Trump , said Burr ’ s vote could make Lara Trump — a Wilmington native and Trump ’ s daughter-in-law — the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to run .\\\\nShe is considering it .\\\\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mark Walker of Greensboro is already a declared candidate .\\\\nHe called Burr ’ s vote “ wrong ” and said he ’ d be a “ true conservative champion ” in a fundraising appeal posted after the vote .\\\\nAnother potential Senate candidate , U.S. Rep. Ted Budd , made it clear he is in the Trump camp moving forward .\\\\n“ I disagree with Sen. Burr ’ s vote , and the hardworking volunteers of the NC GOP are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\\\\n“ All of us in elected leadership are accountable to our consciences , the Constitution , and our constituents .\\\\nThe sooner we unite behind our conservative ideals the better .\\\\nSo , let ’ s get to work building on the timeless principles of America First.\\\\n” North Carolina Democratic Party chairman Wayne Goodwin sought to frame the battle over Trump as a “ civil war.\\\\n” “ It says a lot about the fractures that have been exposed by the Trump trial vote , ” Goodwin said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election and more and more of the general election itself is going to be a vote on whether the Republican Party itself is going to become even more aligned with Trumpism or shed that.\\\\n” At least two of the other Republican senators to vote guilty face censure from their state parties — Bill Cassidy in Louisiana and Ben Sasse in Nebraska .\\\\nFor more North Carolina government and politics news , listen to the Under the Dome politics podcast from The News & Observer and the NC Insider .\\\\nYou can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stitcher , iHeartRadio , Amazon Music , Megaphone or wherever you get your podcasts .\", \"McConnell proposing that impeachment trial start in February. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is proposing to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of the impeachment trial of former President Trump until February , multiple sources familiar with the plan tell CBS News .\\\\nMcConnell confirmed his proposal in a statement late Thursday .\\\\nThis would give impeachment managers and Mr. Trump \\'s defense at least a week to prepare .\\\\nMcConnell floated the proposal to GOP senators on a caucus conference call Thursday .\\\\nMcConnell , now in the minority , does not have final say on when a trial would be .\\\\nSchumer would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told reporters late Thursday that he has not yet heard back from Schumer on his proposal , adding , `` we \\'re going to continue to talk about it . \\'\\'\\\\n`` Senate Republicans are strongly united behind the principle that the institution of the Senate , the office of the presidency , and former President Trump himself all deserve a full and fair process that respects his rights and the serious factual , legal , and constitutional questions at stake , \\'\\' McConnell said in his statement .\\\\n`` Given the unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our proposed timeline for the initial phases includes a modest and reasonable amount of additional time for both sides to assemble their arguments before the Senate would begin to hear them . \\'\\'\\\\nUnder McConnell \\'s proposed timeline , the House impeachment managers would read the article to the Senate and senators would be sworn into the court of impeachment on January 28 , a Thursday .\\\\nFrom that day , Mr. Trump would have a week to answer the article and the House \\'s pre-trial brief would be due , meaning February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week from when he submits his answer to also submit his pre-trial brief , meaning February 11 .\\\\nThe House would have two days after that ( February 13 ) to submit their rebuttal pre-trial brief .\\\\nThe House has yet to send the single article of impeachment for incitement of insurrection to the Senate .\\\\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham praised McConnell \\'s proposal to delay the trial into February and said he met with McConnell on Thursday .\\\\n`` We looked at historically pre-trial periods .\\\\nThe difference is there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a snap impeachment .\\\\nBut when you look at the time periods involved , it \\'s very similar to what we \\'ve done in the past , \\'\\' Graham told reporters .\\\\nGraham confirmed that attorney Butch Bowers is joining the Trump legal team as `` the anchor tenant . \\'\\'\\\\nGraham praised Butcher as a `` solid guy . \\'\\'\\\\nThe South Carolina senator said he had no insight into whether Mr. Trump would attend the trial , but recommended that he should n\\'t .\\\\n`` The president looks forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham said .\\\\n`` Believes it \\'s unconstitutional and damages his presidency , but you know , he \\'s gon na \\' have his day in court and that \\'s the way the system works . \\'\\'\\\\nThe House impeached Mr. Trump last week , on January 13 , with 10 Republicans joining Democrats .\\\\nSenators are currently scheduled to be working from their states during the week of February 15 for Presidents \\' Day , potentially complicating the timeline .\\\\nAt the moment , the Senate is also working to confirm President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Coons told CNN Thursday Democrats could be open to a slight delay in the trial if there \\'s progress in confirming nominees .\\\\n`` I think Democrats will be open to considering a delay that allows former President Trump time to assemble his legal team and his defense for the impeachment trial if we are making progress on confirming the very talented , seasoned , and diverse team President Joe Biden has nominated to serve in his Cabinet , \\'\\' Coons said .\\\\nMcConnell has not said publicly whether he supports or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mob that attacked the Capitol was `` provoked by the president . \\'\\'\"]}}'"

         "Several congressional Republicans are expressing their public opposition to President Joe Biden ’ s nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) over her past ties to ecoterrorist activity .\nSen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) , who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , the committee that will vote on Tracy Stone-Manning ’ s nomination ahead of a full Senate vote , said he plans to object to the nomination .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists who had booby trapped trees with metal spikes .\n… She did not cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Barrasso said in a statement .\nSen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P. Blount who was sentenced to 17 months in prison for tree spiking .\nFormer BLM Acting Director William Perry Pendley detailed in an op-ed with Breitbart News how Stone-Manning ’ s testimony came in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed a profane letter Blount had given her to the U.S. Forest Service warning of trees that had been spiked .\nStone-Manning , who around the same timeframe was a member of the radical environmentalist group Earth First !\n— which engaged in ecoterrorism — had initially been subpoenaed in 1989 over the tree spiking case .\nPendley wrote : Tree spiking is the act of installing metal spikes into trees , creating a dangerous or even deadly scenario for loggers should their saw come into contact with the spikes .\nTree spiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a federal crime .\nPendley noted Stone-Manning also admitted to the Missoulian in 1993 that she could have been charged with conspiracy , just as others had been , if it were not for her immunity agreement .\nIn a questionnaire for her Senate committee hearing , Stone-Manning claimed she was never the subject of a criminal investigation and that the tree spiking case to which she is linked was merely “ alleged ” tree spiking — despite the facts that she was a target in the 1989 grand jury investigation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1993 interview that she would have been charged with conspiracy in the tree spiking crime if it were not for her immunity agreement , and the crime did occur and the individuals she testified against were convicted for it .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning lied to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by claiming the tree spiking was ‘ alleged ’ and that she was never investigated , ” Barrasso asserted .\n“ Now , we have confirmation that neither of those things are true .\nPresident Biden must withdraw her nomination.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive portion of which is in Alaska .\nSen. Dan Sullivan ( R-AK ) voiced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a lengthy statement last week as he emphasized the magnitude of the bureau ’ s influence over his state .\nSullivan called her nomination “ shocking , ” and the state ’ s senior senator , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-AK ) — who is often a key swing vote for Republicans — said she too intends to vote against Stone-Manning .\nMurkowski , being a member of the Energy Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found responses to “ Alaska specific issues ” she asked during Stone-Manning ’ s committee hearing to be “ unsatisfactory and evasive.\n” A major Idaho logging group representing more than 500 businesses also released a letter this week , obtained by the Federalist , calling for the Senate to reject Stone-Manning .\nSeveral senators from states that are logging industry hotbeds , such as Georgia , Washington , Oregon , and Maine , have not publicly indicated their positions , nor have moderate Democrat Sens .\nJoe Manchin ( WV ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 50 Senate Republicans vote against Stone-Manning , just one Democrat breaking with the party would sink her nomination in the upper chamber , which is split 50–50 .\nOn Monday , 15 House Republicans wrote a letter to Manchin , who along with often toeing party lines also happens to be the Energy Committee chair , urging him to oppose Stone-Manning over the tree spiking plot and her “ overtly partisan past.\n” Bob Abbey , former President Barack Obama ’ s first BLM director , told E & E News he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ should disqualify her.\n” “ BLM needs a really strong leader , ” Abbey said .\n“ To put someone in that position that has this type of resume will just bring needless controversy that is not good for the agency or for the public lands.\n” The Biden administration , for its part , has stood by the nomination despite the numerous calls for her to withdraw .\nAn administration source told Fox News , “ She has always been honest and transparent about this matter , which has been covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately testified against the responsible individual , who was convicted .\n”",

Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P. Blount who was sentenced to 17 months in prison for tree spiking .\nFormer BLM Acting Director William Perry Pendley detailed in an op-ed with Breitbart News how Stone-Manning ’ s testimony came in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed a profane letter Blount had given her to the U.S. Forest Service warning of trees that had been spiked .\nStone-Manning , who around the same timeframe was a member of the radical environmentalist group Earth First !\n— which engaged in ecoterrorism — had initially been subpoenaed in 1989 over the tree spiking case .\nPendley wrote : Tree spiking is the act of installing metal spikes into trees , creating a dangerous or even deadly scenario for loggers should their saw come into contact with the spikes .\nTree spiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a federal crime .\nPendley noted Stone-Manning also admitted to the Missoulian in 1993 that she could have been charged with conspiracy , just as others had been , if it were not for her immunity agreement .\nIn a questionnaire for her Senate committee hearing , Stone-Manning claimed she was never the subject of a criminal investigation and that the tree spiking case to which she is linked was merely “ alleged ” tree spiking — despite the facts that she was a target in the 1989 grand jury investigation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1993 interview that she would have been charged with conspiracy in the tree spiking crime if it were not for her immunity agreement , and the crime did occur and the individuals she testified against were convicted for it .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning lied to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by claiming the tree spiking was ‘ alleged ’ and that she was never investigated , ” Barrasso asserted .\n“ Now , we have confirmation that neither of those things are true .\nPresident Biden must withdraw her nomination.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive portion of which is in Alaska .\nSen. Dan Sullivan ( R-AK ) voiced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a lengthy statement last week as he emphasized the magnitude of the bureau ’ s influence over his state .\nSullivan called her nomination “ shocking , ” and the state ’ s senior senator , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-AK ) — who is often a key swing vote for Republicans — said she too intends to vote against Stone-Manning .\nMurkowski , being a member of the Energy Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found responses to “ Alaska specific issues ” she asked during Stone-Manning ’ s committee hearing to be “ unsatisfactory and evasive.\n” A major Idaho logging group representing more than 500 businesses also released a letter this week , obtained by the Federalist , calling for the Senate to reject Stone-Manning .\nSeveral senators from states that are logging industry hotbeds , such as Georgia , Washington , Oregon , and Maine , have not publicly indicated their positions , nor have moderate Democrat Sens .\nJoe Manchin ( WV ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 50 Senate Republicans vote against Stone-Manning , just one Democrat breaking with the party would sink her nomination in the upper chamber , which is split 50–50 .\nOn Monday , 15 House Republicans wrote a letter to Manchin , who along with often toeing party lines also happens to be the Energy Committee chair , urging him to oppose Stone-Manning over the tree spiking plot and her “ overtly partisan past.\n” Bob Abbey , former President Barack Obama ’ s first BLM director , told E & E News he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ should disqualify her.\n” “ BLM needs a really strong leader , ” Abbey said .\n“ To put someone in that position that has this type of resume will just bring needless controversy that is not good for the agency or for the public lands.\n” The Biden administration , for its part , has stood by the nomination despite the numerous calls for her to withdraw .\nAn administration source told Fox News , “ She has always been honest and transparent about this matter , which has been covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately testified against the responsible individual , who was convicted .\n”",

         "Algeria has been in turmoil since early 2019 .\nA popular anti-government street protest movement , called Hirak , gathered massive support across different ethnic and social segments of the society and is still ongoing .\nTo this , the government has responded with laws and measures that limit freedom of expression , and has often justified that by the need to fight the pandemic .\nThe Hirak movement started on February 2019 , a few days after president Abdelaziz Boutefikla , in power since 1999 , announced he would run for a fifth mandate .\nThe people of Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 .\nEventually , Boutefikla conceded defeat and resigned on April 2 , 2019 .\nYet , his resignation did not bring changes expected by a majority of Algerians .\nThey therefore continued to protest peacefully every single Friday across the country to press for significant political changes and an end to large-scale corruption .\nAs this Twitter account that monitors the Hirak movement explains , the issue at play is the mindset of the government which is perceived as using various arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip over society : The authorities did eventually respond to the movement by holding presidential elections in December 2020 , which were won by Abdelmajid Tebboune .\nYet , the vote was largely boycotted , reflecting little confidence within significant parts of the population in his candidacy as many Algerians did not see him as much different from his predecessors .\nIndeed , while Tebboune had initially expressed support to the Hirak movement , he eventually changed his views and supported the passing of legislation restricting digital freedom of expression in Algeria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in legislation during the pandemic The first significant change happened in April 2020 .\nThe Algerian parliament and senate voted amendments to the Penal Code which introduced heavier sentences in the context of peculiar situations , including times of pandemic .\nVillage de la justice [ Justice Village ] , a online publication established by legal experts , explains this in its article : More coercive legislation under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa ( CIPESA ) .\nBecome a Patron !\nOr support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Activist Post for truth , peace , and freedom news

movement started on February 2019 , a few days after president Abdelaziz Boutefikla , in power since 1999 , announced he would run for a fifth mandate .\nThe people of Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 .\nEventually , Boutefikla conceded defeat and resigned on April 2 , 2019 .\nYet , his resignation did not bring changes expected by a majority of Algerians .\nThey therefore continued to protest peacefully every single Friday across the country to press for significant political changes and an end to large-scale corruption .\nAs this Twitter account that monitors the Hirak movement explains , the issue at play is the mindset of the government which is perceived as using various arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip over society : The authorities did eventually respond to the movement by holding presidential elections in December 2020 , which were won by Abdelmajid Tebboune .\nYet , the vote was largely boycotted , reflecting little confidence within significant parts of the population in his candidacy as many Algerians did not see him as much different from his predecessors .\nIndeed , while Tebboune had initially expressed support to the Hirak movement , he eventually changed his views and supported the passing of legislation restricting digital freedom of expression in Algeria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in legislation during the pandemic The first significant change happened in April 2020 .\nThe Algerian parliament and senate voted amendments to the Penal Code which introduced heavier sentences in the context of peculiar situations , including times of pandemic .\nVillage de la justice [ Justice Village ] , a online publication established by legal experts , explains this in its article : More coercive legislation under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights

their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis ’ 83 in 2006 .\nPlus , some agonizing history in Atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 .\nThe Braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year .\nThe Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season .\nAnd then there was the big one , the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl .\nBut these Braves , not this time .\nFavored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title , the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July .\nEarlier , 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy .\nProjected ace Mike Soroka never got back from an Achilles injury .\nGoing into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork .\nThey had a guy who made his big league debut in October , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago .\nToss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew .\nMany continue to heckle them as the “ Cheatin ’ Astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever .\nCertainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker .\nA World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century .\nThe 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones , aces Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux and John Smoltz , and manager Bobby Cox .\nThose rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles .\nThe 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season .\nHis 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park , and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 Boston Braves , too , dubbed the “ Miracle Braves ” back in the day .\nIn last place on the Fourth of July , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A ’ s — to earn their nickname .\nThe Braves ’ previous title came at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , their first home after moving from Milwaukee to the Deep South in 1966 .\nThen there was Turner Field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled Minute Maid Park .\nQuite a change from last October .\nOnly a limited capacity was permitted for that World Series as the Dodgers beat Tampa Bay at a neutral-site stadium in Arlington , Texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus .\nNow , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months .\nA squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport .\nIn the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal .\nAstros : Scheduled to start the spring training schedule on Feb. 26 vs. St. Louis .",

Bush 's daily intelligence briefer and was traveling with the president on the day the planes hit the towers , will also share personal reflections and new details about the CIA 's race to provide answers and protect the country from further terror attacks .\nThe series will launch the week of August 9 and run for five weeks , with its first episode premiering on August 11 , 2021 and its final episode running on September 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attacks : `` I 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , or for us as individuals .

We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide

to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to

seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed

bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

''\nThe vote to impeach was divided almost entirely along partisan lines , with only one independent voting to impeach Mr. Trump , and three Democrats voting against impeachment on at least one article .\nThe impeachment proceedings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and more bipartisan affair .\nMr. Trump was impeached a second time one week after he urged supporters to `` fight like hell '' to overturn the election ahead of Congress ' scheduled counting of the Electoral College results January 6 .\nFollowing his speech at the rally , a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol , resulting in the deaths of five people .\nCongress did n't return to count the Electoral College votes for six hours , and several Republican lawmakers still voted to overturn the election results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impeach Mr. Trump was brought to the House floor on January 11 , with the House forgoing the traditional process of holding hearings and conducting an investigation into any wrongdoing .\nThere was only one article of impeachment this time , charging Mr. Trump with `` Incitement of Insurrection . ''\nTen Republicans joined all 222 Democrats in voting to impeach Mr. Trump , bringing the vote to 232 to 197 .\nAfter Mr. Trump was impeached in 2019 , Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not announce the impeachment managers until January 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis year , Pelosi announced the impeachment managers on the same day as the vote to impeach Mr. Trump , January 13 , 2021 .\nIn 2020 , senators were sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts as members of the impeachment court on January 16 , and the trial began on Tuesday , January 21 .\nMr. Trump was acquitted almost exactly two weeks later , on February 5 .\nSenator Mitt Romney , voted to convict the president one charge , `` Abuse of Power , '' the only Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either charge .\nThis year 's trial is expected to be very different .\nSome Republicans have argued that it is unconstitutional to impeach a president who is no longer in office , but the Constitution does not specify whether a president needs to be in office to be impeached .\nIt is also unclear how long the second trial will last , or what evidence either side would choose to bring .\nPelosi argued on Thursday that this impeachment trial would differ from Mr. Trump 's first impeachment trial , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 urging Ukraine to investigate then-candidate Joe Biden .\nMr. Trump defended his call to Zelensky as `` perfect . ''\n`` This year , the whole world bore witness to the President 's incitement , to the execution of his call to action , and the violence that was used , '' Pelosi said .\n`` I do see a big difference between something that we all witnessed versus what information you might need to substantiate an Article of Impeachment based on , large part , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as 'perfect . '\n'' Mr. Trump 's legal team has yet to be officially announced , but one of his lawyers will be South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers , who has experience representing politicians embroiled in scandals .\nAlthough the chief justice of the Supreme Court traditionally presides over an impeachment trial in accordance with the constitution , Roberts may not want to participate in a second impeachment trial against Mr. Trump .\nIn that case , Vice President Kamala Harris would preside over the trial as president of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so , Senate president pro tempore Patrick Leahy would preside .\nA two-thirds majority of the Senate , 67 votes , is required to convict the president .\nDemocrats hold 50 seats in the Senate , and it is unlikely they could garner support from 17 Republicans to convict Mr. Trump , particularly since he is no longer in office .\nHowever , more Republicans may vote to convict Mr. Trump than in 2020 , as he has been harshly criticized by some GOP senators for encouraging violence among his supporters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted by the Senate , Congress would then vote on whether to bar him from seeking elected office again .\nOnly a simple majority is needed to bar him from holding office .\nMany Republicans argue that holding a trial after Mr. Trump has left office is divisive , but Democrats counter that it is necessary to hold an impeachment trial for Mr. Trump in order to show that a president must be accountable for his actions even in his last month of his term in office .",

         "President Joe Biden Begins With A Plea: \"We Must End This Uncivil War\"",
         "Biden ’ s speech was delivered on the site where Trump supporters targeted their violence because many of them believed conspiracy theories that Democrats had stolen the presidential election .\nSome of them were white supremacists , carrying Confederate flags through the Capitol — a culmination of four years of tacit endorsement of these groups by the former president .\nHis inaugural address echoed the call he has made throughout his campaign and in the months since winning the election , for Americans to “ give each other a chance ” as he said in November .\nIn that space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become even more complicated .\nBiden ’ s clear purpose in his first speech as president : to calm tensions , set a hopeful tone , and convince Americans that some kind of unity is possible , despite that attack and the years of division and hate groups incited by his predecessor .\n“ We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue , rural versus urban , conservative versus liberal , ” Biden said in his address at the Capitol .\n“ We can do this , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts .\nIf we show a little tolerance and humility , and if we ’ re willing to stand in the other person ’ s shoes , as my mom would say , just for a moment , stand in their shoes.\n” President Joe Biden was sworn into office on Wednesday , on the steps of the Capitol , where Trump supporters staged a violent attempt at insurrection two weeks ago , determined not to accept his victory in the election .\nIt was distinctly in contrast to Donald Trump ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dark and foreboding tones , where he swore the end of “ American carnage.\n” Trump was absent on Wednesday , both in person and in spirit , going unmentioned by Biden except by omission .\n“ I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today .\nI thank you from the bottom of my heart , and I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation , ” Biden said , which had the effect of framing Trump as an aberration .\nBiden sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol as fringe elements , not representative of the vast majority of Americans and sent a message that he believes American democracy can survive .\n“ Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people , to stop the work of our democracy , to drive us from this sacred ground , ” he said .\n“ It did not happen .\nIt will not happen .\nNot today , not tomorrow , not ever .\nNot ever.\n” Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just the Trump presidency , but to begin to move on from Trump ’ s political legacy of mistrust , conspiracy , and racism .\nHe appealed to those who supported Trump as well as those who want to see progressive action from this post-Trump president .\n“ To all of those who did not support us , let me say this : Hear me out as we move forward , ” he said .\n“ Take a measure of me and my heart .\nAnd if you still disagree , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat ’ s America .\nThe right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps this nation 's greatest strength .\nYet hear me clearly : Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\n” The new president , who backs some progressive policies but essentially remains a mainstream Democrat who believes in cooperation with the Republican Party , will find it hard to avoid wading into those cultural rifts almost immediately .\nIn the hours after being inaugurated , he will begin to enact policies that pointedly try to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you I will fight just as hard for those who did not support me , ” he said in his speech .\nWhat that means in practice remains to be seen , with a close Democratic majority in the House , a Democratic-controlled 50-50 Senate , and a Republican Party struggling to re-shape its identity after Trump .\nThe fissures that Trump exacerbated over the past four years go well beyond disagreements based on policy — for many Americans they are about who holds power and who is valued in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left to try to unravel the lack of trust in government from both people caught up in conspiracy theories on the right and those who have felt abandoned by the Democratic party on the left .\nAfter winning the Electoral College in December , Biden gave a speech that tried to tamp down what has been an obviously growing threat to stability in the US — the rise of the QAnon mass delusion , fueled by Trump — and the mistrust of government that comes with it .\nStill , three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBiden taking office will not put much of a damper on those theories , judging by how believers have adapted to rationalize every event , including Biden ’ s election win , as being part of a right-wing nationalist master plan headed up by Trump.Biden tried in his inaugural speech to close not just the Trump presidency , but to begin to move on from Trump ’ s political legacy of mistrust , conspiracy , and racism .\nHe appealed to those who supported Trump as well as those who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n“ To all of those who did not support us , let me say this : Hear me out as we move forward , ” he said .\n“ Take a measure of me and my heart .\nAnd if you still disagree , so be it .\nThat ’ s democracy .\nThat ’ s America .\nThe right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps this nation 's greatest strength .\nYet hear me clearly : Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\n” Biden acknowledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of silent prayer , called for as his first act as president , to remember the more than 400,000 Americans who have died in the past year as a result of the coronavirus .\nAnd he took a moment to mark the history of Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first woman vice president .\n“ Don ’ t tell me things can ’ t change , ” Biden said .\nBiden spoke to skepticism in his speech , to those who think “ unity ” is particularly far-fetched in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days .\nI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real , ” he said .\n“ But I also know they are not new .\nOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh , ugly reality that racism , nativism , fear , demonization have long torn us apart .\nThe battle is perennial and victory is never assured.\n” He insisted though that the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , ever , ever failed in America when we have acted together , ” he said .\n“ So today , at this time , at this place , let ’ s start afresh , all of us .\nLet ’ s begin to listen to one another again , hear one another , see one another , show respect to one another .\nPolitics doesn ’ t need to be a raging fire , destroying everything in its path .\nEvery disagreement doesn ’ t have to be a cause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\n” His allies who joined him on Wednesday stuck with Biden ’ s optimism .\n`` There 's a profound difference between having a president focused on bringing Americans together and a president doing the opposite , ” Pete Buttigieg , Biden ’ s nominee for transportation secretary , told BuzzFeed News when asked ahead of the president ’ s speech how Biden ’ s plea for unity will work , particularly in the wake of the Capitol attack .\n“ So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful . ''\n`` But I think the biggest thing that 'll unify the American people is delivering results .\nAnd that 's , that 's where all of us are hoping to come in , '' he said .\nAnd he added that the location of the inauguration is particularly resonant this year .\n“ I think it 's poetic that this event will take place in good order , just two weeks after what America watched in horror in this very space.\n” For two new Democratic members of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hope will be a more stable time in politics and in America more broadly .\n“ One of my colleagues right here , Sara Jacobs from California , she said earlier that we 've been members of Congress for three Wednesdays , ” said Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams after Biden ’ s address .\n“ The first Wednesday , we had an insurrection on the Capitol .\nThe second Wednesday , we voted to impeach the president .\nAnd then this Wednesday , we 're here .\nMy husband , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday , you text me and say , “ I had a bagel.\n” ’ ” Williams , who was the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party before launching her Congressional campaign , spoke to BuzzFeed News at the end of the inaugural ceremony , still standing on the West front of the Capitol .\n“ We have a Jewish American and a Black man both being sworn in and to the United States Senate from Georgia , y'all , ” she said , referring to the Wednesday afternoon swearings in of Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won their Senate runoff races earlier this month .\n“ We 've come a long way in this country .\nWe still have a ways to go .\nBut I 'm not gon na let any domestic terrorists steal my joy and what I 'm feeling on this day and the pride that I feel to be an American today.\n” She talked about the pride she felt in seeing Vice President Kamala Harris , an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sister , sworn in as the first woman and first woman of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , “ it 's more than just the symbolism of what happened today , with the first woman , the first woman of color being the Vice President , and changing of an administration , but everything that it means for so many people at home across the country that are hurting , ” through the pandemic .\nAsked about Biden ’ s call for unity and his inclination to try to work with Republicans , Williams said quoted James Baldwin .\n“ ‘ I can love and work with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity , ’ ” she said .\n“ And so there are some people that I 'm absolutely not willing to work with , because they do n't even think that I , as a Black woman , should be here serving in this body .\nBut then there are people who we have a policy disagreement , and we can work together and we can find that common ground , but there is a clear divide in where we are.\n” “ My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've seen countries around the world torn apart and having their societies frayed at the seams , ” added newly-elected California Rep. Sara Jacobs .\n“ And we know it 's possible to hold people accountable and bring people back together and rebuild those community ties and rebuild our country .\n”",

master plan headed up by Trump.Biden tried in his inaugural speech to close not just the Trump presidency , but to begin to move on from Trump ’ s political legacy of mistrust , conspiracy , and racism .\nHe appealed to those who supported Trump as well as those who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n“ To all of those who did not support us , let me say this : Hear me out as we move forward , ” he said .\n“ Take a measure of me and my heart .\nAnd if you still disagree , so be it .\nThat ’ s democracy .\nThat ’ s America .\nThe right to dissent peaceably within the guardrails of our republic is perhaps this nation 's greatest strength .\nYet hear me clearly : Disagreement must not lead to disunion.\n” Biden acknowledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of silent prayer , called for as his first act as president , to remember the more than 400,000 Americans who have died in the past year as a result of the coronavirus .\nAnd he took a moment to mark the history of Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first woman vice president .\n“ Don ’ t tell me things can ’ t change , ” Biden said .\nBiden spoke to skepticism in his speech , to those who think “ unity ” is particularly far-fetched in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days .\nI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real , ” he said .\n“ But I also know they are not new .\nOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh , ugly reality that racism , nativism , fear , demonization have long torn us apart .\nThe battle is perennial and victory is never assured.\n” He insisted though that the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , ever , ever failed in America when we have acted together , ” he said .\n“ So today , at this time , at this place , let ’ s start afresh , all of us .\nLet ’ s begin to listen to one another again , hear one another , see one another , show respect to one another .\nPolitics doesn ’ t need to be a raging fire , destroying everything in its path .\nEvery disagreement doesn ’ t have to be a cause for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\n” His allies who joined him on Wednesday stuck with Biden ’ s optimism .\n`` There 's a profound difference between having a president focused on bringing Americans together and a president doing the opposite , ” Pete Buttigieg , Biden ’ s nominee for transportation secretary , told BuzzFeed News when asked ahead of the president ’ s speech how Biden ’ s plea for unity will work , particularly in the wake of the Capitol attack .\n“ So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful . ''\n`` But I think the biggest thing that 'll unify the American people is delivering results .\nAnd that 's , that 's where all of us are hoping to come in , '' he said .\nAnd he added that the location of the inauguration is particularly resonant this year .\n“ I think it 's poetic that this event will take place in good order , just two weeks after what America watched in horror in this very space.\n” For two new Democratic members of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hope will be a more stable time in politics and in America more broadly .\n“ One of my colleagues right here , Sara Jacobs from California , she said earlier that we 've been members of Congress for three Wednesdays , ” said Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams after Biden ’ s address .\n“ The first Wednesday , we had an insurrection on the Capitol .\nThe second Wednesday , we voted to impeach the president .\nAnd then this Wednesday , we 're here .\nMy husband , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday , you text me and say , “ I had a bagel.\n” ’ ” Williams , who was the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party before launching her Congressional campaign , spoke to BuzzFeed News at the end of the inaugural ceremony , still standing on the West front of the Capitol .\n“ We have a Jewish American and a Black man both being sworn in and to the United States Senate from Georgia , y'all , ” she said , referring to the Wednesday afternoon swearings in of Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won their Senate runoff races earlier this month .\n“ We 've come a long way in this country .\nWe still have a ways to go .\nBut I 'm not gon na let any domestic terrorists steal my joy and what I 'm feeling on this day and the pride that I feel to be an American today.\n” She talked about the pride she felt in seeing Vice President Kamala Harris , an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sister , sworn in as the first woman and first woman of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , “ it 's more than just the symbolism of what happened today , with the first woman , the first woman of color being the Vice President , and changing of an administration , but everything that it means for so many people at home across the country that are hurting , ” through the pandemic .\nAsked about Biden ’ s call for unity and his inclination to try to work with Republicans , Williams said quoted James Baldwin .\n“ ‘ I can love and work with anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity , ’ ” she said .\n“ And so there are some people that I 'm absolutely not willing to work with , because they do n't even think that I , as a Black woman , should be here serving in this body .\nBut then there are people who we have a policy disagreement , and we can work together and we can find that common ground , but there is a clear divide in where we are.\n” “ My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've seen countries around the world torn apart and having their societies frayed at the seams , ” added newly-elected California Rep. Sara Jacobs .\n“ And we know it 's possible to hold people accountable and bring people back together and rebuild those community ties and rebuild our country .\n”",

Shelby of Alabama , the Senate ’ s fourth most senior member , has told confidantes that he does not intend to run for reelection next year_— prompting some Republicans to urge the powerful , establishment politician to reconsider , even as potential replacements prepare to run for his seat .\nThe senator in recent weeks told one close Alabama ally that he was not planning on running in 2022 for what would be his seventh term , according to the ally , who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke with The Associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person said some in the state were still trying to get Shelby to change his mind out of concern about losing clout and worries that the senator might be replaced by a fringe candidate who would not be as effective .\nShelby spokeswoman Blair Taylor said Friday that the senator has not made a decision , “ but there will likely be an announcement forthcoming in the next few weeks.\n” “ As I previously stated , the Senator has not made a decision or an announcement regarding whether or not he plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just that , speculation , ” Taylor wrote in an email Friday .\nA titan of Alabama politics , the 86-year-old politician has spent 42 years in Washington , serving first in the House before the Senate .\nHis stepping down would leave a power void for the region .\nIt would also set off a free-for-all primary in a national party deeply divided between traditional Republicans like Shelby and those who model themselves on former President Donald Trump .\nShelby was elected to the Senate in 1986 as a conservative Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power in the Deep South , but he switched to the GOP in 1994 .\nHe 's spent the past two years as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , before Democrats gained control of the chamber .\nAll along , he has used his influence to benefit the state 's interests , particularly ports and military manufacturers .\nHe played a key role in bringing an FBI campus and the newly announced Space Command to Huntsville .\n“ I don ’ t know anybody who knows how to wield power like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Alabama-based political consultant .\n“ I would say that is his greatest accomplishment , to get money allocated to the state for many different projects , ” former Alabama Republican Party Chairman Bill Armistead said .\nAlabama 's political circles have long braced for a Shelby retirement .\nArmistead said the senator told him during his 2016 bid for reelection that it was his last campaign , but Armistead added the caveat that , “ Things change.\n” Several months ago , Shelby told a group of business leaders at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than run again , according to a person in attendance who was not authorized to discuss the event and also spoke on condition of anonymity .\nA list of potential GOP replacements is waiting in the wings .\nPossible candidates include Shelby ’ s former chief of staff , Katie Boyd Britt , who now heads an influential business lobby and who would likely have the senator ’ s backing if she decided to enter the race .\nAlabama Secretary of State John Merrill , who suspended his 2020 Senate campaign when former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , said he would consider a run .\nRep.

         "North Carolina Republicans quickly condemned U.S. Sen. Richard Burr ’ s surprising guilty vote Saturday in the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump .\nBurr was one of seven Republicans to vote for conviction in the U.S. Senate .\nThe vote was 57-43 in favor of conviction , falling shy of the two-thirds ( or 67-vote ) threshold needed to convict Trump for his role in inciting the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol .\n“ North Carolina Republicans sent Senator Burr to the United States Senate to uphold the Constitution and his vote today to convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shocking and disappointing , ” NCGOP chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement .\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mark Walker , who is running for the retiring Burr ’ s seat in the 2022 election , sent out a fundraising appeal immediately after Burr ’ s vote .\n“ Wrong vote , Sen. Burr .\nI am running to replace Richard Burr because North Carolina needs a true conservative champion as their next senator , ” Walker tweeted .\nU.S. Rep. Dan Bishop , a Charlotte Republican , said in a tweet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBurr , 65 , is in his third term as a senator after serving five terms in the U.S. House .\nHe hasn ’ t been seen as a moderate , unlike several of the other Republicans who voted to convict .\nAnd Burr voted twice against holding the trial on constitutional grounds .\nBut once the Senate voted to hold the trial , he said , he considered the merits of the case as an impartial juror .\n“ The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the charge rises to the level of high Crimes and Misdemeanors .\nTherefore , I have voted to convict , ” Burr said in a statement after the vote .\nRepublican Thom Tillis , North Carolina ’ s junior senator , voted to acquit Trump after the five-day trial .\nThe seven Republican votes in favor of conviction was the most ever cast by a president ’ s own party in the history of American impeachment .\n“ What it speaks to is that there is not unanimity in the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not unanimity about what the path forward is or what role Trump should play , ” said Donald Corbett , an associate professor of law at N.C. Central University .\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden , but secured more than 74 million votes from Americans — the second-most in history behind only Biden ’ s more than 81 million .\nThroughout the campaign and after the election , Trump repeatedly claimed falsely that the election had been fraudulent and was stolen from him .\nTrump ’ s appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally on Jan. 6 in Washington , D.C. That was the same day members of Congress were to certify Biden ’ s electoral college victory with Vice President Mike Pence presiding .\nRioters breached the Capitol and at least five people were killed in the immediate aftermath , including one police officer .\n“ The President promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election because he did not like the results .\nAs Congress met to certify the election results , the President directed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt the lawful proceedings required by the Constitution .\nWhen the crowd became violent , the President used his office to first inflame the situation instead of immediately calling for an end to the assault , ” Burr said in his statement .\nTrump was impeached by the U.S. House on Jan. 13 , and Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20 .\nSome Republican members , including Tillis , cast their not guilty votes in constitutional terms .\nAlthough he was unsurprised by the outcome , longtime Republican strategist Carter Wrenn said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight with Trump .\n“ After all the howling and mess we had , impeachment just continued it , ” Wrenn said .\n“ I think most people would just as soon it stopped.\n” But Burr , Wrenn said , made a better case for the vote to convict Trump than he expected — and he pushed back against the N.C. GOP ’ s criticism of the senior senator .\n“ I understand how the Republican Party feels , and I respect their feelings , ” Wrenn said .\n“ I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off if both sides just stop their arguing and bickering and put this part of the 2020 election behind us.\n” The state party ’ s quick rebuke of Burr fits with similar condemnations against other Republicans who have spoken out against Trump , including members of the U.S. House who voted for impeachment .\nTrump , though he is no longer the president , remains a towering figure in the party .\n“ Republicans are hedging their bets because they don ’ t know how much power Trump is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbett said .\n“ I think for a lot of them , both individually and collectively , it didn ’ t make political sense to make him angry .\nHe ’ s still the most powerful Republican in the country — and he has a long memory.\n” Even if Trump doesn ’ t run for president in 2024 , he will likely have an out-sized impact on the GOP primary field .\nBut Trump ’ s acquittal also underscored , to some , the disparity between the presidency and Congress .\nPower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — no matter the party .\n“ Have we now collectively in some way altered the concept of checks and balances in the Constitution ?\nThat ’ s the thing that I ’ m wary about , ” Corbett said .\nAndy Taylor , professor of political science at N.C.

Richard Burr ’ s surprising guilty vote Saturday in the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump .\nBurr was one of seven Republicans to vote for conviction in the U.S. Senate .\nThe vote was 57-43 in favor of conviction , falling shy of the two-thirds ( or 67-vote ) threshold needed to convict Trump for his role in inciting the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol .\n“ North Carolina Republicans sent Senator Burr to the United States Senate to uphold the Constitution and his vote today to convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shocking and disappointing , ” NCGOP chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement .\nFormer U.S. Rep. Mark Walker , who is running for the retiring Burr ’ s seat in the 2022 election , sent out a fundraising appeal immediately after Burr ’ s vote .\n“ Wrong vote , Sen. Burr .\nI am running to replace Richard Burr because North Carolina needs a true conservative champion as their next senator , ” Walker tweeted .\nU.S. Rep. Dan Bishop , a Charlotte Republican , said in a tweet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBurr , 65 , is in his third term as a senator after serving five terms in the U.S. House .\nHe hasn ’ t been seen as a moderate , unlike several of the other Republicans who voted to convict .\nAnd Burr voted twice against holding the trial on constitutional grounds .\nBut once the Senate voted to hold the trial , he said , he considered the merits of the case as an impartial juror .\n“ The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the charge rises to the level of high Crimes and Misdemeanors .\nTherefore , I have voted to convict , ” Burr said in a statement after the vote .\nRepublican Thom Tillis , North Carolina ’ s junior senator , voted to acquit Trump after the five-day trial .\nThe seven Republican votes in favor of conviction was the most ever cast by a president ’ s own party in the history of American impeachment .\n“ What it speaks to is that there is not unanimity in the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not unanimity about what the path forward is or what role Trump should play , ” said Donald Corbett , an associate professor of law at N.C. Central University .\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden , but secured more than 74 million votes from Americans — the second-most in history behind only Biden ’ s more than 81 million .\nThroughout the campaign and after the election , Trump repeatedly claimed falsely that the election had been fraudulent and was stolen from him .\nTrump ’ s appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally on Jan. 6 in Washington , D.C. That was the same day members of Congress were to certify Biden ’ s electoral college victory with Vice President Mike Pence presiding .\nRioters breached the Capitol and at least five people were killed in the immediate aftermath , including one police officer .\n“ The President promoted unfounded conspiracy theories to cast doubt on the integrity of a free and fair election because he did not like the results .\nAs Congress met to certify the election results , the President directed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt the lawful proceedings required by the Constitution .\nWhen the crowd became violent , the President used his office to first inflame the situation instead of immediately calling for an end to the assault , ” Burr said in his statement .\nTrump was impeached by the U.S. House on Jan. 13 , and Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20 .\nSome Republican members , including Tillis , cast their not guilty votes in constitutional terms .\nAlthough he was unsurprised by the outcome , longtime Republican strategist Carter Wrenn said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight with Trump .\n“ After all the howling and mess we had , impeachment just continued it , ” Wrenn said .\n“ I think most people would just as soon it stopped.\n” But Burr , Wrenn said , made a better case for the vote to convict Trump than he expected — and he pushed back against the N.C. GOP ’ s criticism of the senior senator .\n“ I understand how the Republican Party feels , and I respect their feelings , ” Wrenn said .\n“ I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off if both sides just stop their arguing and bickering and put this part of the 2020 election behind us.\n” The state party ’ s quick rebuke of Burr fits with similar condemnations against other Republicans who have spoken out against Trump , including members of the U.S. House who voted for impeachment .\nTrump , though he is no longer the president , remains a towering figure in the party .\n“ Republicans are hedging their bets because they don ’ t know how much power Trump is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corbett said .\n“ I think for a lot of them , both individually and collectively , it didn ’ t make political sense to make him angry .\nHe ’ s still the most powerful Republican in the country — and he has a long memory.\n” Even if Trump doesn ’ t run for president in 2024 , he will likely have an out-sized impact on the GOP primary field .\nBut Trump ’ s acquittal also underscored , to some , the disparity between the presidency and Congress .\nPower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — no matter the party .\n“ Have we now collectively in some way altered the concept of checks and balances in the Constitution ?\nThat ’ s the thing that I ’ m wary about , ” Corbett said .\nAndy Taylor , professor of political science at N.C. State University , said that process has been a long time coming .\n“ It ’ s literally impossible , ” he said , to get the votes necessary to convict a president in the Senate .\n“ Members of Congress will talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really do anything about it , ” Taylor said .\nBut he noted that Trump made the unequal nature of those branches much more clear .\n“ He really threw the cold water on us , ” Taylor said .\nBurr won ’ t have to face Republican voters in another primary .\nHe announced during his 2016 re-election bid that he is not running again — and has not wavered from that .\nHe could , as other Republicans who have voted against Trump have , face a more official rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bishop suggested .\nTen Republicans in the U.S. House voted for impeachment , and the Senate vote was the most bipartisan in U.S. history during a presidential impeachment .\nThe severity of the attack on the Capitol meant to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power certainly stuck with some members .\nBurr called it “ an angry mob ” and remarked how “ dangerously close ” members and congressional staff came to crossing paths with the rioters , who were seeking them out on Jan. 6 .\n“ The precipitating event is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this impeachment will be remembered for , ” Taylor said .\n“ It ’ s going to be a very long time before people can expunge that from their memory.\n” Others were more complimentary of Burr ’ s decision .\nBurr defeated Democrat Deborah Ross in his 2016 re-election bid , but Ross — now a first-term member of the U.S. House — said : “ I applaud Senator Burr for voting his conscience.\n” For more North Carolina government and politics news , listen to the Domecast politics podcast from The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou can find it on Megaphone , Apple Podcasts , iHeartRadio , Stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts .",

         "The issue : North Carolina ’ s incoming congressman , Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn , announced that he will vote against accepting the results of the presidential race , in a video filled with misinformation about the 2020 election .\nWhy we ’ re checking this : The video was retweeted by President Donald Trump and has been viewed millions of times .\nWhat you need to know : Cawthorn , 25 , was sworn in Sunday to represent much of western North Carolina in Congress .\nIn a 6-minute video posted three days earlier , he repeated many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Trump has made in his efforts to cling to power .\nHe plans to join other Republicans in trying to vote to stop Democratic President-elect Joe Biden from taking office .\n“ My first act as a member of Congress will be to object to the Electoral College certification of the 2020 election , ” Cawthorn said .\nThe New York Times called that effort “ futile ” because to work it would have to pass both the House of Representatives and the Senate .\nThe House is controlled by Democrats .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ top Republican Sen.

''\nHistorian John Baick linked the Rittenhouse advocacy to `` military groups across the country , anti-mask protests , school board protests '' — that is to say , a move among the GOP towards the view that violence and chaos is an acceptable response to political disagreement .\nIndeed , the celebration of Rittenhouse 's violence has been accompanied by Republicans in statehouses passing laws to make it easier to get away with killing left-wing protesters .\nAs Jess Bidgood of the Boston Globe reported last month , `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dozens of injuries , at least three deaths '' due to right-wingers mowing down protesters with their cars .\nBut rather than prosecute such people , `` Oklahoma and 15 other states have considered bills protecting drivers , '' and in many cases , they 've passed them .\nThe love for Rittenhouse — or similarly , the way Capitol insurrectionist Ashli Babbitt has been turned into a Trumpian martyr — is not an anomalous event .\nIt 's a sign of a systematic shift across Republican America , in both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , to the view that co-existence with liberal Americans is no longer possible .\nConservatives continue to believe , despite the recent Virginia gubernatorial win , that they and their ideas can not compete in free and fair elections .\nAnd so violence to crush the left is becoming an ever more acceptable answer in GOP circles .\nLate last week , ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl released audio of an interview in which Trump argues that it was `` common sense '' for his supporters who stormed the Capitol to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was justified , Trump suggested , because `` the people were very angry '' and the `` vote is fraudulent . ''\n( The vote was not , in fact , fraudulent , and this is just a racist conspiracy theory like Trump 's other favorite racist conspiracy theory , that Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen . )\nIt 's clear that Trump continues to believe , as he did on January 6 , that Pence both had the right and the obligation to simply declare the 2020 election null @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply no legal or factual basis for the claim .\nAnd he sees violence in the name of trying to force this vision as justified and , in his words , `` common sense . ''\nBut , of course , Republican leaders are n't abandoning Trump over this .\nInstead , they bat away questions about whether or not such endorsements of political violence are a good idea .\nThere 's absolutely no evidence this is slowing down Trump 's momentum for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination , which he has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half years before voting even starts .\nIn their 2021 year out memo released Monday , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote , `` The moment Washington Republicans felt their grip on power loosen , they unleashed a full assault on American democracy , culminating in a murderous assault on the Capitol and the introduction of anti-voter legislation across the country . ''\nThis is not an exaggeration .\nIf anything , it 's an understatement , if only because Democrats continue to sidestep the F-word .\nUnderstandably so — way too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't happen here '' mentality , and check out mentally the second the word `` fascism '' is in play .\nBut it 's all there in the GOP .\nRepublicans embrace violence to get their way .\nThey promote a white nationalist definition of the national character .\nThey display an eagerness to censor dissenting views , through violence or book-burning .\nAnd share a belief that the law is not about justice , but enshrining the power of a right-wing minority over everyone else .\nTheirs is an absolutist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy .\nPerhaps calling it by its name does n't help move the needle of public opinion or get voters to wake up any faster .\nBut Trumpism is just fascism , and Trumpism is what the GOP is about these days .",

''\nHistorian John Baick linked the Rittenhouse advocacy to `` military groups across the country , anti-mask protests , school board protests '' — that is to say , a move among the GOP towards the view that violence and chaos is an acceptable response to political disagreement .\nIndeed , the celebration of Rittenhouse 's violence has been accompanied by Republicans in statehouses passing laws to make it easier to get away with killing left-wing protesters .\nAs Jess Bidgood of the Boston Globe reported last month , `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dozens of injuries , at least three deaths '' due to right-wingers mowing down protesters with their cars .\nBut rather than prosecute such people , `` Oklahoma and 15 other states have considered bills protecting drivers , '' and in many cases , they 've passed them .\nThe love for Rittenhouse — or similarly , the way Capitol insurrectionist Ashli Babbitt has been turned into a Trumpian martyr — is not an anomalous event .\nIt 's a sign of a systematic shift across Republican America , in both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , to the view that co-existence with liberal Americans is no longer possible .\nConservatives continue to believe , despite the recent Virginia gubernatorial win , that they and their ideas can not compete in free and fair elections .\nAnd so violence to crush the left is becoming an ever more acceptable answer in GOP circles .\nLate last week , ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl released audio of an interview in which Trump argues that it was `` common sense '' for his supporters who stormed the Capitol to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was justified , Trump suggested , because `` the people were very angry '' and the `` vote is fraudulent . ''\n( The vote was not , in fact , fraudulent , and this is just a racist conspiracy theory like Trump 's other favorite racist conspiracy theory , that Barack Obama is not a natural-born citizen . )\nIt 's clear that Trump continues to believe , as he did on January 6 , that Pence both had the right and the obligation to simply declare the 2020 election null @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply no legal or factual basis for the claim .\nAnd he sees violence in the name of trying to force this vision as justified and , in his words , `` common sense . ''\nBut , of course , Republican leaders are n't abandoning Trump over this .\nInstead , they bat away questions about whether or not such endorsements of political violence are a good idea .\nThere 's absolutely no evidence this is slowing down Trump 's momentum for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination , which he has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half years before voting even starts .\nIn their 2021 year out memo released Monday , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wrote , `` The moment Washington Republicans felt their grip on power loosen , they unleashed a full assault on American democracy , culminating in a murderous assault on the Capitol and the introduction of anti-voter legislation across the country . ''\nThis is not an exaggeration .\nIf anything , it 's an understatement , if only because Democrats continue to sidestep the F-word .\nUnderstandably so — way too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't happen here '' mentality , and check out mentally the second the word `` fascism '' is in play .\nBut it 's all there in the GOP .\nRepublicans embrace violence to get their way .\nThey promote a white nationalist definition of the national character .\nThey display an eagerness to censor dissenting views , through violence or book-burning .\nAnd share a belief that the law is not about justice , but enshrining the power of a right-wing minority over everyone else .\nTheirs is an absolutist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy .\nPerhaps calling it by its name does n't help move the needle of public opinion or get voters to wake up any faster .\nBut Trumpism is just fascism , and Trumpism is what the GOP is about these days .",

         "Former President Donald Trump has seven key weapons in his arsenal as he plots a political comeback .\n• It may seem as if former President Donald Trump just disappeared .\nHe has n't .\n• Political committees , government facilities , and media are all part of Trump 's comeback plan now that he 's survived a 2nd impeachment trial .\n• Creating a political party and running for president in 2024 are the two biggest choices Trump has .\nYou 're forgiven if former President Donald Trump has lulled you into believing he 's canceled .\nAfter all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Trump impeachment trial , acquitting him as expected but excoriating his conduct .\nTwitter banished him .\nSo did Facebook , YouTube , Instagram , and Snapchat .\nTrump fled Washington , DC , on January 20 for his gilded Florida redoubt of Mar-a-Lago after promising to `` never '' give up his fight for four more years in the White House .\nAnd since the moment President-elect Joe Biden became President Joe Biden , Trump has all but disappeared .\nHe has n't made a speech .\nHe has n't appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a trademark straight-to-camera video .\nBut do n't fool yourself .\nTrump 's still here .\nHe 's waiting , and scheming , and calculating , and building .\nHe might start a new political party .\nHe might even run for president again .\nIn a year , or a month , or a day , Trump will roar back — exasperating Democrats , independents , and a good many Republicans .\nAnd Insider has identified seven distinct weapons in his arsenal — from political committees to government facilities to media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is primed to stage his comeback .\nTrump 's Save America PAC released a photo showing the former president meeting with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on January 28 .\nEarly in the maelstrom of Trump 's election-results denial , the politically doomed president quietly formed a new committee that , by its very creation on November 9 , tacitly acknowledged his second White House term might not materialize .\nTrump called the `` leadership '' political action committee Save America .\nIt 's a curious name for a president who for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep America Great '' slogan that implied Trump had already saved America from Democrats , socialists , antifa , and other `` enemy of the people '' miscellany .\nRegardless , Save America is a kind of committee that a former president can use to spend money on many things that help keep him very much in the national conversation .\n`` Trump 's Save America PAC may very well be a textbook example of a political slush fund , '' Meredith McGehee , the executive director of the bipartisan ethics-reform watchdog Issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use the money he raises for this PAC to support like-minded candidates , Trump may also use these funds to cover travel , lodging , dining , legal expenses , or entertainment expenses like golfing — including at Trump properties — for years to come . ''\nTrump immediately tethered Save America to his presidential-campaign committee and the Republican National Committee .\nHe did so under the auspices of Trump Make America Great Again — a joint fundraising committee that shared money it raised among its three members .\nThis detail is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Again incessantly fundraised throughout November and December .\nMuch of the money messaging via emails and text messages enticed MAGA-ites to meet an `` election defense fund goal . ''\n`` Will you allow the CORRUPT Democrats to try to STEAL this Election and impart their RADICAL agenda on our Country ? ''\none typical come-on from November said .\nBut most Trump supporters were likely oblivious to the fact that they were n't primarily funding Trump election-integrity efforts .\nSay someone responded with a $ 100 contribution .\nSave America would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RNC would take the rest for its operating account , according to a donation allotment formula published in the credit-card submission page 's fine print .\nNo matter that the RNC and Trump presidential campaign , not Save America , were leading legal and ballot-recount efforts in a bid to deny Biden the presidency .\nAt 1:24 p.m. on January 6 , as a mob of Trump supporters were on the verge of attacking the US Capitol , Trump Make America Great Again blasted another email fundraising plea , with the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` Every single Patriot from across the Country must step up RIGHT NOW if we 're going to successfully DEFEND the integrity of this Election .\nPresident Trump is calling on YOU to bolster our Official Defend America Fund , '' the message said .\n`` Please contribute $ 5 immediately to the Official Defend America Fund and to increase your impact by 1000 % . ''\nSave America spent about $ 125,000 during its first two weeks in existence , according to federal records .\nEvery cent went toward fundraising fees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those records indicated .\nDuring its first two weeks , Save America raised more than $ 569,000 .\nThat was before its fundraising blitz truly began .\nFrom November 24 through December 31 , Trump 's new PAC raised nearly $ 30.9 million , according to a Federal Election Commission disclosure submitted Sunday night .\nBut Save America did n't spend a dime during that period on Trump 's efforts to `` defend the integrity '' of the 2020 election or otherwise overturn election results .\nInstead , the PAC again spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $ 218,000 in all .\nSave America ended 2020 with about $ 31.2 million after starting with zero dollars not two months before .\nSo what now ?\nIn January , Save America served as Trump 's platform to target Rep. Liz Cheney , the Wyoming Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney who voted last month to impeach Trump on one count of inciting an insurrection .\nThe PAC last week released a poll that indicated Liz Cheney was vulnerable to a Republican primary challenge .\n`` It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among general election voters and have collapsed among Republicans and Trump voters , '' the pollster John McLaughlin wrote to the Trump advisor Jason Miller in a memorandum obtained by Politico .\nThe siren song of in-person political rallies is likely to lure Trump from Florida to friendly places across the country .\nWhen that happens , Save America is an obvious vehicle for him to fund and organize such events .\nTrump dubbed his Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago the `` Winter White House . ''\nNow he is housing his post-presidency office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the exile White House On January 25 , Trump announced he had formally opened the `` Office of the Former President . ''\nIt will be based at Trump 's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach , Florida , the private club overlooking the Atlantic Ocean where the ex-president also now lives .\nTaxpayers will in part fund it .\nFormer presidents are entitled by law to these kinds of offices .\nFormer President Barack Obama works from Washington .\nFormer President George W. Bush stationed himself in Dallas .\nAnd former President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut Trump 's office signals something else entirely .\nBy placing it within Mar-a-Lago , which Trump dubbed `` the Winter White House '' early in his term , Trump gives himself a certain extension of a presidency with which he has n't quite parted .\nHe 'll have an official staff coterie .\nThe Secret Service will protect him there .\nFormer Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is even back to help build its communications capabilities .\nBecause of the events of the past month , the office name 's acknowledgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the US — is also itself striking .\nOnly four weeks ago Trump , who was still insisting he won the 2020 election , declared : `` We will not break .\nWe will never give in .\nWe will never give up .\nWe will NEVER surrender . ''\nIn a statement last week , Trump 's new office said it would be `` responsible for managing President Trump 's correspondence , public statements , appearances , and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration through advocacy , organizing , and public activism . ''\nIt added : `` President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American People . ''\nIn the evening of January 31 , Trump 's new office announced the `` highly respected '' lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L.

         "7 yuuge reasons Donald Trump isn't going away. Former President Donald Trump has seven key weapons in his arsenal as he plots a political comeback .\n• It may seem as if former President Donald Trump just disappeared .\nHe has n't .\n• Political committees , government facilities , and media are all part of Trump 's comeback plan now that he 's survived a 2nd impeachment trial .\n• Creating a political party and running for president in 2024 are the two biggest choices Trump has .\nYou 're forgiven if former President Donald Trump has lulled you into believing he 's canceled .\nAfter all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Trump impeachment trial , acquitting him as expected but excoriating his conduct .\nTwitter banished him .\nSo did Facebook , YouTube , Instagram , and Snapchat .\nTrump fled Washington , DC , on January 20 for his gilded Florida redoubt of Mar-a-Lago after promising to `` never '' give up his fight for four more years in the White House .\nAnd since the moment President-elect Joe Biden became President Joe Biden , Trump has all but disappeared .\nHe has n't made a speech .\nHe has n't appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a trademark straight-to-camera video .\nBut do n't fool yourself .\nTrump 's still here .\nHe 's waiting , and scheming , and calculating , and building .\nHe might start a new political party .\nHe might even run for president again .\nIn a year , or a month , or a day , Trump will roar back — exasperating Democrats , independents , and a good many Republicans .\nAnd Insider has identified seven distinct weapons in his arsenal — from political committees to government facilities to media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is primed to stage his comeback .\nTrump 's Save America PAC released a photo showing the former president meeting with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on January 28 .\nEarly in the maelstrom of Trump 's election-results denial , the politically doomed president quietly formed a new committee that , by its very creation on November 9 , tacitly acknowledged his second White House term might not materialize .\nTrump called the `` leadership '' political action committee Save America .\nIt 's a curious name for a president who for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep America Great '' slogan that implied Trump had already saved America from Democrats , socialists , antifa , and other `` enemy of the people '' miscellany .\nRegardless , Save America is a kind of committee that a former president can use to spend money on many things that help keep him very much in the national conversation .\n`` Trump 's Save America PAC may very well be a textbook example of a political slush fund , '' Meredith McGehee , the executive director of the bipartisan ethics-reform watchdog Issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use the money he raises for this PAC to support like-minded candidates , Trump may also use these funds to cover travel , lodging , dining , legal expenses , or entertainment expenses like golfing — including at Trump properties — for years to come . ''\nTrump immediately tethered Save America to his presidential-campaign committee and the Republican National Committee .\nHe did so under the auspices of Trump Make America Great Again — a joint fundraising committee that shared money it raised among its three members .\nThis detail is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Again incessantly fundraised throughout November and December .\nMuch of the money messaging via emails and text messages enticed MAGA-ites to meet an `` election defense fund goal . ''\n`` Will you allow the CORRUPT Democrats to try to STEAL this Election and impart their RADICAL agenda on our Country ? ''\none typical come-on from November said .\nBut most Trump supporters were likely oblivious to the fact that they were n't primarily funding Trump election-integrity efforts .\nSay someone responded with a $ 100 contribution .\nSave America would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RNC would take the rest for its operating account , according to a donation allotment formula published in the credit-card submission page 's fine print .\nNo matter that the RNC and Trump presidential campaign , not Save America , were leading legal and ballot-recount efforts in a bid to deny Biden the presidency .\nAt 1:24 p.m. on January 6 , as a mob of Trump supporters were on the verge of attacking the US Capitol , Trump Make America Great Again blasted another email fundraising plea , with the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` Every single Patriot from across the Country must step up RIGHT NOW if we 're going to successfully DEFEND the integrity of this Election .\nPresident Trump is calling on YOU to bolster our Official Defend America Fund , '' the message said .\n`` Please contribute $ 5 immediately to the Official Defend America Fund and to increase your impact by 1000 % . ''\nSave America spent about $ 125,000 during its first two weeks in existence , according to federal records .\nEvery cent went toward fundraising fees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those records indicated .\nDuring its first two weeks , Save America raised more than $ 569,000 .\nThat was before its fundraising blitz truly began .\nFrom November 24 through December 31 , Trump 's new PAC raised nearly $ 30.9 million , according to a Federal Election Commission disclosure submitted Sunday night .\nBut Save America did n't spend a dime during that period on Trump 's efforts to `` defend the integrity '' of the 2020 election or otherwise overturn election results .\nInstead , the PAC again spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $ 218,000 in all .\nSave America ended 2020 with about $ 31.2 million after starting with zero dollars not two months before .\nSo what now ?\nIn January , Save America served as Trump 's platform to target Rep. Liz Cheney , the Wyoming Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney who voted last month to impeach Trump on one count of inciting an insurrection .\nThe PAC last week released a poll that indicated Liz Cheney was vulnerable to a Republican primary challenge .\n`` It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among general election voters and have collapsed among Republicans and Trump voters , '' the pollster John McLaughlin wrote to the Trump advisor Jason Miller in a memorandum obtained by Politico .\nThe siren song of in-person political rallies is likely to lure Trump from Florida to friendly places across the country .\nWhen that happens , Save America is an obvious vehicle for him to fund and organize such events .\nTrump dubbed his Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago the `` Winter White House . ''\nNow he is housing his post-presidency office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the exile White House On January 25 , Trump announced he had formally opened the `` Office of the Former President . ''\nIt will be based at Trump 's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach , Florida , the private club overlooking the Atlantic Ocean where the ex-president also now lives .\nTaxpayers will in part fund it .\nFormer presidents are entitled by law to these kinds of offices .\nFormer President Barack Obama works from Washington .\nFormer President George W. Bush stationed himself in Dallas .\nAnd former President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut Trump 's office signals something else entirely .\nBy placing it within Mar-a-Lago , which Trump dubbed `` the Winter White House '' early in his term , Trump gives himself a certain extension of a presidency with which he has n't quite parted .\nHe 'll have an official staff coterie .\nThe Secret Service will protect him there .\nFormer Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is even back to help build its communications capabilities .\nBecause of the events of the past month , the office name 's acknowledgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the US — is also itself striking .\nOnly four weeks ago Trump , who was still insisting he won the 2020 election , declared : `` We will not break .\nWe will never give in .\nWe will never give up .\nWe will NEVER surrender . ''\nIn a statement last week , Trump 's new office said it would be `` responsible for managing President Trump 's correspondence , public statements , appearances , and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration through advocacy , organizing , and public activism . ''\nIt added : `` President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American People . ''\nIn the evening of January 31 , Trump 's new office announced the `` highly respected '' lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L. Castor Jr. would lead the former president 's impeachment defense .\n`` Both Schoen and Castor agree that this impeachment is unconstitutional , '' the statement said .\nShortly after Trump 's impeachment trial acquittal on February 13 , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump comeback — of one sort or another .\nIn part , it read : `` Our historic , patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun .\nIn the months ahead I have much to share with you , and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people .\nThere has never been anything like it !

         "Global Elite Use 3 Giant Financial Companies To Control 88% Of The Corporations Listed On The S&P 500",
         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

         "global elite use 3 giant financial companies to control 88% of the corporations listed on the s&p 500. there is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today . they control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use . tens of millions of americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries . but of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the s & p 500 . the three financial companies that i am talking about are blackrock , vanguard and state street . according to cnn , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… but that is actually an old number . i wanted to come up with a newer number , and so i started digging . according to wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of january 2021… vanguard is nearly as big . according to wikipedia , vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of january 2021… while not as large as the other two , state street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year . easiest way to get your first bitcoin ( ad ) so adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in january 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now . that is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine . sometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is . if you were alive when jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet . collectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the s & p 500… being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power . for example , last month blackrock and vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on exxonmobil ’ s board of directors… blackrock and vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on exxonmobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting . the two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of exxonmobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a engine no . 1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees exxonmobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk . engine no . 1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry . exxonmobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them . and these new board members will help to ensure that exxonmobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite . for those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe . in fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do . unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners . at this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top . if you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks . we need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” . because even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society . america ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power . today , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing . in fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this . and don ’ t expect our politicians in washington to do anything . they want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on wall street . ***michael ’ s new

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the

'' download , rate and subscribe here : itunes , spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to intelligence matters . it is very good to have you on the show . and much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again . winston wiley : good to talk to you . michael morell : so , winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , i wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career . and one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that i would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me . and i do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to hawaii . and i had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday . i really took that to heart . and for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pdb staff , briefing the president , serving overseas . and i just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and i think should be important to them . winston wiley : oh , well , thank you for remembering that . i do n't remember in as much details as you just made . it 's consistent with what i believe and what i tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place . i saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better . so my time in ctc and then coming back to be addi and adci for homeland security was kind of true to that . and i and i tried to share that with as many people as possible . and i 'm glad you found it useful . michael morell : i listened . i actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory . before we talk about 9/11 , i 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 . we 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later . but but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ? winston wiley : ok. well , you know , how did i wind up with the agency is pretty easy . i was born into it . my dad was not in o.s.s . but was a charter member of cia when it was formed in '47 . and the time i was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , i went to american university and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family . i then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that i 'd have a career in operations . but i found my interim assignments and the directorate of intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old office of current intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the near east and south asian analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late bob ames and helene boatner . worked for them until 1985 or so . then i went to the office of global issues as a deputy to david carey , who later became executive director of the agency . i worked for dave four or five times . and got my first division assignment running the international issues division in ogi . and i did that for five years . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ig staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for bob layton and the office of near east south asian analysis , as head of the persian gulf division . and that 's where i was when on the day saddam invaded kuwait in 1991 . worked through 1992 on running persian gulf division and found time to look for another job after five years at nesa and was asked to become the deputy in the in the counterterrorism center . the center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst . and i got to work with steve ahr as his deputy for two years . steve moved up to be the chief of the ne division and i took over as chief of ctc . and brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order . and i spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where i found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence . michael morell : so , winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence . you were in charge of all the analysts . you were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 . can you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ? winston wiley : well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out . we write the first draft and put to bed the president 's daily brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those . in the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the di . and my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible . michael morell ? winston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in ctc and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ? how were you thinking about that ? winston wiley : well , we 'd been worried about al-qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew . while i was still in ctc , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort . really with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al qaeda as a group . we tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one . after 9/11 , that changed . michael morell : ok , winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ? i know you did not plan to come to work that day . can you walk us through it for us ? winston wiley : well . indeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at bwi airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to california @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the united states as the attacks were going on . i 'll never forget the phone call i got as i was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the world trade center . i sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morell : so i suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ? winston wiley : yes . i knew it in my bones . it did n't require me to sit down and ponder . a single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident . a second , no sir . you know , i ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise . winston wiley : it would have to have been at the top of the list . a coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the pentagon and later understanding what happened in shanksville . there just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that . michael morell : so what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ? winston wiley : surprisingly , very , very little . when i went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate . at that point . i was directed towards the security guy who told me i needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - i went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand . an unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to bwi michael morell : and did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ? winston wiley : i got to the gate . and i had told them , you know , 'you guys are n't flying today . ' the word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled . i was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you took them home . and did you come to work then ? winston wiley : well , i took them home . but you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home . and that was just a solid jam . i turned around and went to the baltimore washington parkway and took that down . it took a lifetime of living in the washington area , knowing back roads to get to places . all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower pennsylvania , delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the pentagon fire . and i guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where i rejoined my deputies and george and others . i was in touch by phone . the team knew very well what to do , if nothing else . i mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus . and the team fell back on that . and , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support . i think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period . leave it to him to decide . michael morell : so , winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? well , i 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could . what that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-qaida and its supporters ? we had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate . my immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing ctc analytic firepower . and i remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , i think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to ctc and created an office of terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center . michael morell : so , in fact , you moved , i think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts . michael morell : yeah . and i remember entire teams . right . teams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken . winston wiley : well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one . they would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated . we asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be . and i gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that . but the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases i think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible . there were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the fbi stand up its new analytic capability . the president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to cia for help in . and you provided it . winston wiley : well , i 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the fbi counterterrorism folks during my time in ctc , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while . and , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help . it was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts . that was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the ctc . but we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities . it 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing . the analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was . so it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business . michael morell : so , yeah , and then i think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which i think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ? winston wiley : yeah . when you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground.. many , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work . and i think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small . but that is a labor intensive task . michael morell : so sometime after 9/11 , george tenet , the director of central intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position . can you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in june of the following year , the director asked if i would stand up a position , called the associate director for homeland security . by then the white house had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level department of homeland security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue . as adci , he asked not that i assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homeland security , but that i use the background and knowledge that i had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort . i added one deputy from the ops directorate at cia , another deputy from nsa , one from dia and one from nsa , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities . at the time , the dci had both cia and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point . and so with the creation of ctc those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side . and , you know , i think even if you worked in that environment for a while . michael morell : so , winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u.s. government brought osama bin laden to justice on may 1st , 2011 . what was your reaction ? what was your reaction when you heard that ? winston wiley : elation . just , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever i was watching , there was really only one thing i could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , i watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated . michael morell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , i want you to compare it to the bringing of mir aimal kanzi to justice . i think you were at dulles airport , along with director tenet when the fbi returned him to the united states from pakistan . and maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there . winston wiley : well , mir aimal kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three . that began - at the time i was the relatively new deputy director in ctc and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work . and i was in ctc for five years after that . and every night before i left , i got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for mir aimal kanzi . without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the fbi was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the united states to be turned over to virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here . i was asked along with many others , if i wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , i would not have missed it . i wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers . i saw him march by on the arms of brad garrett , the lead fbi officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers . but brad marched them from the air force plane that brought him into dulles airport , because it was in virginia and in the same fairfax county district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ? it was n't elation at all . it was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when i saw , 'wow , what a weaselly little character he was . ' micahel morell : winston , i would n't be doing my job if i did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course . we 're taping this the day after kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the taliban won . and i 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday . winston wiley : michael , it 's too soon . i 've been you know , i 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment . it will change us . i hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : i 'm winston , maybe just one more question , and i was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about bob ames . yes . and you talked about working for him when he was running the near east south asia office . and i would bet most of my listeners do n't know about bob . and i was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened . since we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the middle east , there is a book that was written by kai bird about him , 'the perfect spy ' by kai bird . to all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read . bob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people i 've met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle east . and director casey asked him to take over nesa and one of the very few people that i recall , having served as both the director of a di office and in a senior position . and as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building . his loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man . i think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency . and we lost him far too young an age . michael morell : winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",
