         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

@ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Several congressional Republicans are expressing their public opposition to President Joe Biden ’ s nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) over her past ties to ecoterrorist activity .\nSen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) , who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , the committee that will vote on Tracy Stone-Manning ’ s nomination ahead of a full Senate vote , said he plans to object to the nomination .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists who had booby trapped trees with metal spikes .\n… She did not cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Barrasso said in a statement .\nSen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P. Blount who was sentenced to 17 months in prison for tree spiking .\nFormer BLM Acting Director William Perry Pendley detailed in an op-ed with Breitbart News how Stone-Manning ’ s testimony came in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed a profane letter Blount had given her to the U.S. Forest Service warning of trees that had been spiked .\nStone-Manning , who around the same timeframe was a member of the radical environmentalist group Earth First !\n— which engaged in ecoterrorism — had initially been subpoenaed in 1989 over the tree spiking case .\nPendley wrote : Tree spiking is the act of installing metal spikes into trees , creating a dangerous or even deadly scenario for loggers should their saw come into contact with the spikes .\nTree spiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a federal crime .\nPendley noted Stone-Manning also admitted to the Missoulian in 1993 that she could have been charged with conspiracy , just as others had been , if it were not for her immunity agreement .\nIn a questionnaire for her Senate committee hearing , Stone-Manning claimed she was never the subject of a criminal investigation and that the tree spiking case to which she is linked was merely “ alleged ” tree spiking — despite the facts that she was a target in the 1989 grand jury investigation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1993 interview that she would have been charged with conspiracy in the tree spiking crime if it were not for her immunity agreement , and the crime did occur and the individuals she testified against were convicted for it .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning lied to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by claiming the tree spiking was ‘ alleged ’ and that she was never investigated , ” Barrasso asserted .\n“ Now , we have confirmation that neither of those things are true .\nPresident Biden must withdraw her nomination.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive portion of which is in Alaska .\nSen. Dan Sullivan ( R-AK ) voiced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a lengthy statement last week as he emphasized the magnitude of the bureau ’ s influence over his state .\nSullivan called her nomination “ shocking , ” and the state ’ s senior senator , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-AK ) — who is often a key swing vote for Republicans — said she too intends to vote against Stone-Manning .\nMurkowski , being a member of the Energy Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found responses to “ Alaska specific issues ” she asked during Stone-Manning ’ s committee hearing to be “ unsatisfactory and evasive.\n” A major Idaho logging group representing more than 500 businesses also released a letter this week , obtained by the Federalist , calling for the Senate to reject Stone-Manning .\nSeveral senators from states that are logging industry hotbeds , such as Georgia , Washington , Oregon , and Maine , have not publicly indicated their positions , nor have moderate Democrat Sens .\nJoe Manchin ( WV ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 50 Senate Republicans vote against Stone-Manning , just one Democrat breaking with the party would sink her nomination in the upper chamber , which is split 50–50 .\nOn Monday , 15 House Republicans wrote a letter to Manchin , who along with often toeing party lines also happens to be the Energy Committee chair , urging him to oppose Stone-Manning over the tree spiking plot and her “ overtly partisan past.\n” Bob Abbey , former President Barack Obama ’ s first BLM director , told E & E News he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ should disqualify her.\n” “ BLM needs a really strong leader , ” Abbey said .\n“ To put someone in that position that has this type of resume will just bring needless controversy that is not good for the agency or for the public lands.\n” The Biden administration , for its part , has stood by the nomination despite the numerous calls for her to withdraw .\nAn administration source told Fox News , “ She has always been honest and transparent about this matter , which has been covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately testified against the responsible individual , who was convicted .\n”",

John Barrasso ( R-WY ) , who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , the committee that will vote on Tracy Stone-Manning ’ s nomination ahead of a full Senate vote , said he plans to object to the nomination .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists who had booby trapped trees with metal spikes .\n… She did not cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Barrasso said in a statement .\nSen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P. Blount who was sentenced to 17 months in prison for tree spiking .\nFormer BLM Acting Director William Perry Pendley detailed in an op-ed with Breitbart News how Stone-Manning ’ s testimony came in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed a profane letter Blount had given her to the U.S. Forest Service warning of trees that had been spiked .\nStone-Manning , who around the same timeframe was a member of the radical environmentalist group Earth First !\n— which engaged in ecoterrorism — had initially been subpoenaed in 1989 over the tree spiking case .\nPendley wrote : Tree spiking is the act of installing metal spikes into trees , creating a dangerous or even deadly scenario for loggers should their saw come into contact with the spikes .\nTree spiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a federal crime .\nPendley noted Stone-Manning also admitted to the Missoulian in 1993 that she could have been charged with conspiracy , just as others had been , if it were not for her immunity agreement .\nIn a questionnaire for her Senate committee hearing , Stone-Manning claimed she was never the subject of a criminal investigation and that the tree spiking case to which she is linked was merely “ alleged ” tree spiking — despite the facts that she was a target in the 1989 grand jury investigation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1993 interview that she would have been charged with conspiracy in the tree spiking crime if it were not for her immunity agreement , and the crime did occur and the individuals she testified against were convicted for it .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning lied to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by claiming the tree spiking was ‘ alleged ’ and that she was never investigated , ” Barrasso asserted .\n“ Now , we have confirmation that neither of those things are true .\nPresident Biden must withdraw her nomination.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive portion of which is in Alaska .\nSen. Dan Sullivan ( R-AK ) voiced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a lengthy statement last week as he emphasized the magnitude of the bureau ’ s influence over his state .\nSullivan called her nomination “ shocking , ” and the state ’ s senior senator , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-AK ) — who is often a key swing vote for Republicans — said she too intends to vote against Stone-Manning .\nMurkowski , being a member of the Energy Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found responses to “ Alaska specific issues ” she asked during Stone-Manning ’ s committee hearing to be “ unsatisfactory and evasive.\n” A major Idaho logging group representing more than 500 businesses also released a letter this week , obtained by the Federalist , calling for the Senate to reject Stone-Manning .\nSeveral senators from states that are logging industry hotbeds , such as Georgia , Washington , Oregon , and Maine , have not publicly indicated their positions , nor have moderate Democrat Sens .\nJoe Manchin ( WV ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 50 Senate Republicans vote against Stone-Manning , just one Democrat breaking with the party would sink her nomination in the upper chamber , which is split 50–50 .\nOn Monday , 15 House Republicans wrote a letter to Manchin , who along with often toeing party lines also happens to be the Energy Committee chair , urging him to oppose Stone-Manning over the tree spiking plot and her “ overtly partisan past.\n” Bob Abbey , former President Barack Obama ’ s first BLM director , told E & E News he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ should disqualify her.\n” “ BLM needs a really strong leader , ” Abbey said .\n“ To put someone in that position that has this type of resume will just bring needless controversy that is not good for the agency or for the public lands.\n” The Biden administration , for its part , has stood by the nomination despite the numerous calls for her to withdraw .\nAn administration source told Fox News , “ She has always been honest and transparent about this matter , which has been covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately testified against the responsible individual , who was convicted .\n”",

''\n“ Some have also contended that the politicalization , by both opponents and proponents , of the decision to forbid local school districts from requiring students to wear a mask at school is gravely wrong .\nLiterally .\nBut , that question is not before the Court , ” the judge wrote .",

their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis ’ 83 in 2006 .\nPlus , some agonizing history in Atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 .\nThe Braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year .\nThe Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season .\nAnd then there was the big one , the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl .\nBut these Braves , not this time .\nFavored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title , the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July .\nEarlier , 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy .\nProjected ace Mike Soroka never got back from an Achilles injury .\nGoing into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork .\nThey had a guy who made his big league debut in October , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago .\nToss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew .\nMany continue to heckle them as the “ Cheatin ’ Astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever .\nCertainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker .\nA World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century .\nThe 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones , aces Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux and John Smoltz , and manager Bobby Cox .\nThose rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles .\nThe 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season .\nHis 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park , and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 Boston Braves , too , dubbed the “ Miracle Braves ” back in the day .\nIn last place on the Fourth of July , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A ’ s — to earn their nickname .\nThe Braves ’ previous title came at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , their first home after moving from Milwaukee to the Deep South in 1966 .\nThen there was Turner Field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled Minute Maid Park .\nQuite a change from last October .\nOnly a limited capacity was permitted for that World Series as the Dodgers beat Tampa Bay at a neutral-site stadium in Arlington , Texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus .\nNow , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months .\nA squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport .\nIn the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal .\nAstros : Scheduled to start the spring training schedule on Feb. 26 vs. St. Louis .",

We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today .

: Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide

, I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to

seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed

line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

It was n't Lin-Manuel Miranda 's idea to appear on screen in `` In the Heights , '' the jubilant new movie adaptation of his 2008 Tony Award-winning musical — the Broadway hit that paved the way for `` Hamilton . ''\nHe says he would have been happy sitting in his writer 's chair and cheering on the cast filming in his own neighborhood .\nBut he was persuaded to take on the small role of Piragüero , who pushes a cart selling shaved ice with fruit-flavored syrups , thanks to the film 's screenplay writer , Quiara Alegría @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , '' Miranda told CBS News .\n`` 'If you 're in it , it 's the surest way the song does n't get cut , ' '' he recalled her suggesting during a pre-production meeting with director Jon M. Chu .\nThe character 's song , `` Piragua , '' is n't essential to the plot , which is why he worried it could face the chopping block .\nBut Miranda sees it as key to what the movie , a love letter to his Washington Heights community set during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n`` It 's a metaphor for the entire neighborhood : Life is hard .\nPrices are going up , but we keep scraping by , '' explained Miranda .\nWhen `` In the Heights '' first premiered at the Richard Rodgers Theatre — the same stage where `` Hamilton '' will reopen after an 18-month pandemic shutdown on September 14 — Miranda , an unknown rising talent full of energy , made his Broadway debut on two fronts .\nHe not only wrote the music and lyrics alongside Hudes , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usnavi , the young bodega owner seeking a better life .\nIt earned him his first two Tony nominations and a win for Best Original Score .\nThe role of Usnavi , which Miranda , now 41 , aged out of , is played in the film by Anthony Ramos , the actor who played John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the original cast of `` Hamilton '' on Broadway .\nMiranda said one of the most joyous days on set for him was filming a duet with Ramos of the song `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't gotten Ramos ' pre-recorded tracks yet , so they had to lip-sync to the original Broadway cast album featuring Miranda 's own voice as Usnavi .\n`` So I was dueting with the voice of myself while staring into my 'Hamilton ' son 's eyes .\nI mean , I will be unpacking this for years , '' he said of the memorable scene — which ended with him `` crying my eyes out '' when Chu said `` cut . ''\nRamos previously played Usnavi in a production of `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C. '' He 's a better Usnavi than I could ever be , honestly , '' Miranda admitted .\n`` He has an incredible skill set that seems to have no ceiling . ''\nMiranda is being modest , as his talents seem to have no ceiling either .\nHe is co-author of a new book , `` In The Heights : Finding Home , '' about the making of the musical and film .\nThe book is set to be released on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the movie opens in theaters nationwide on Thursday , June 10 , while simultaneously streaming on HBO Max .\nIt also coincides with the reopening of the 104-year-old independent Drama Book Shop , which Miranda bought in 2019 with Tommy Kail , the director of `` Heights '' and `` Hamilton '' on Broadway , to rescue from likely demise .\nMiranda has said he wrote many of the `` Heights '' songs in the shop 's basement .\nThe store , now at a new location near Times Square , opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` In the Heights '' has had a special place in Miranda 's heart since he started working on it in college .\nIn 1999 , as a sophomore at Wesleyan University in Connecticut , Miranda drafted the first pages of the musical .\nThis early version was not for course credit , he told Entertainment Tonight at the `` Heights '' 10th anniversary reunion celebration in 2018 .\n`` I just really needed to write it , '' he said of putting a story about his neighborhood to paper and wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n`` This [ story ] was manifested from Lin , when he first decided that he did n't have roles for himself .\nSo he wrote it for himself .\nHe wrote it for his community , '' said Chu , who also directed the 2018 box office hit `` Crazy Rich Asians . ''\n`` In the Heights '' premiered in 2005 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford , Connecticut , followed by a 2007 off-Broadway run .\nThe musical opened on Broadway on March 9 , 2008 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver screen were announced , with Miranda tapped to reprise his role as Usnavi at the time .\nBut it took a decade of setbacks and delays before production finally began .\nUpdates , new moments ... and that line about Donald Trump There have been several updates to the film 's screenplay , and `` lots of new moments '' added .\n`` I 've known these characters so long that when you write for Usnavi and Vanessa and they 're having a new moment , it 's more like taking dictation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they 'll say , '' Miranda said .\n`` It was a joy to revisit them again . ''\nAt first , he said he `` did n't have the courage '' to look at the story differently , but Quiara did .\n`` She said , 'You started this whole thing .\nLet me take a stab at it .\nI think I 'll be braver in terms of adapting this thing that we have co-parented for our entire 20s , ' '' Miranda recalled of getting to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular that was cut almost immediately was a reference to former President Donald Trump in the song `` 96,000 , '' which originally went : '' When I wrote that lyric in 2005 , he was a reality TV host , '' not a politician , Miranda said .\n`` He was just sort of like the human version of the Monopoly man when I was growing up .

Last updated on .From the section Boxing Tyson Fury believes Deontay Wilder is the most dangerous fighter in the heavyweight division and would beat any other rival , including Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua .\nFacing a wounded Wilder is a dangerous task , even if it is not the fight WBC champion Fury or the fans were hoping for .\nThe Briton 's preparation , however , has been far from ideal .\nThe original summer fight date was scrapped when Fury contracted Covid-19 and was quickly rescheduled for October .\nFury then had to rush home to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she went into labour with her sixth child with Fury , Athena , who spent several days in an intensive care unit .\nTo say it 's been a chaotic few months for Fury is an understatement .\nWith all that has happened , it is not hard to see why some might have questions about Fury 's readiness for this fight .\nAnd he can not afford even a moment 's lapse of concentration against the Bronze Bomber .\n`` Wilder 's tailor-made to be his most dangerous and best opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steward - the man who masterminded the devastating performance against Wilder in the rematch 20 months ago .\nSo is Fury ready for an apparently rejuvenated and refocused Wilder ?\nFury pokes fun at suggestions he is not prepared for Wilder , or that he is not fully fit .\n`` Am I 100 % ?\nI 'm a million percent .\nLook at me , I 'm in fantastic shape .\nI 'm as fit as a fiddle , '' Fury said .\n`` I 'm ready today , tomorrow and forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never make excuses , because that 's not me . ''\nFury had to undergo a lengthy quarantine on his return to the UK so he could be with Paris when she had baby Athena on 8 August .\nThe fighter released a heartfelt message when Athena had to spend time in intensive care .\n`` It 's a stressful time , babies and complications , '' Fury said , but he downplayed the effect it might have on his preparations for Wilder .\n`` Camp is usual , I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\n`` I 've been training myself like in the Rocky movie .\nLike I said , what I do n't know about boxing ai n't worth knowing .

         "Ryan Reynolds explains the surprise ‘Free Guy’ cameos — like the only that took only seven minutes. Spoiler alert !\nThe following article discusses important plot points and details from “ Free Guy.\n” Ryan Reynolds ’ new action comedy “ Free Guy ” introduces an original video-game world , though there are plenty of high-profile cameos and a couple fun Disney Easter eggs .\nThe film centers on a background video-game character , Guy ( Reynolds ) , turning from mild-mannered bank teller to a heroic phenomenon in a crazy “ Grand Theft Auto ” -style online landscape when he meets the uber-cool Molotov Girl , an avatar for game programmer Millie ( Jodie Comer ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is threatened by a greedy software mogul Antwan ( Taika Waititi ) and his upcoming “ Free City 2 ” sequel , which will erase Guy and all his video-game friends .\nWhen Guy ’ s exploits in the game prove popular in the real world , he even gets to be a “ Jeopardy !\n” clue : “ This colorful character in the video game ‘ Free City ’ has been turning heads by being the good guy.\n” In a cameo , the late Alex Trebek hints to Guy ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the line , “ Who is he or she indeed.\n” Reynolds has been on the real “ Jeopardy !\n” show a few times , including an appearance in Trebek ’ s last round of episodes before his death last November , and the actor wanted Trebek in “ Free Guy.\n” “ I wouldn ’ t necessarily say I ’ m a friend of the show , but I ’ m friendly to the show , ” Reynolds says .\n“ And then weirdly in this moment , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ’ s as gentlemanly and integrity-filled and as stalwart as you would imagine him to be in real life .\nHe said yes right away , so we came in and grabbed our little cameo and I was super grateful for him for taking the time to do that.\n” Trebek and Reynolds talked frequently , and shortly before his death , the host called Reynolds about a charity function he was doing .\n“ The man was quite beautiful as far as human beings go , that ’ s for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds ’ fellow A-list friends have roles to play in “ Free Guy.\n” Channing Tatum steps up as Revenjamin Buttons , a dance-happy avatar with moves like the “ Shaky Man ” and “ Thanos ’ Glove , ” while others have small voice-only parts : Dwayne Johnson plays a masked bank robber , Tina Fey is a vacuuming mom , John Krasinski is a silhouetted gamer , and Reynolds ’ old pal Hugh Jackman is a masked mystery man in an alley quickly disposed of by Molotov Girl .\n“ I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly rivalries and that sort of stuff .\nHe ’ s one of my closest friends .\nI ’ m really lucky to be able to call him that , ” Reynolds says .\n“ Cameos are part of the showbiz ecosystem .\nI feel like when somebody asks you to do a cameo , unless you ’ re geographically unavailable , I ’ m pretty much always going to say yes.\n” Although Reynolds is well known for his masked quip-meister Deadpool , he gets to borrow from another Marvel Comics character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight : As the whole world watches online , Guy tussles with Dude ( also Reynolds ) , Antwan ’ s ultra-muscular , dimwitted upgrade of Guy .\nJust as Dude unleashes his “ Deathblow ” maneuver in their video-game brawl , Guy suddenly blocks it out of nowhere with Captain America ’ s shield .\nAnd in one of the movie ’ s funniest gags , the scene cuts to Chris Evans ( a.k.a .\nmovie Cap ) in a coffee shop watching on his phone who then shouts , “ What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans was also in Boston when “ Free Guy ” was filming there , and Reynolds texted his friend to come by and do a scene .\n“ He was incredibly kind and gracious , ” Reynolds says .\n“ I told him exactly what was happening and we were 100 % ready for him before he ever even got close to set .\nHe was in and out in about seven minutes.\n” However , Reynolds confirms that it wasn ’ t one of Evans ’ actual movie shields : He didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which purchased 20th Century Fox in 2019 when “ Free Guy ” was in pre-production ) “ would say 100 % yes until after we shot it .\nSo we were leaving room to make that shield something else if we had to.\n” The Mouse House was also cool with the bit where Guy whips out a lightsaber on Dude and the “ Star Wars ” theme kicks in .\n“ It ’ s a pretty special feeling to be in a theater seeing that happen , ” Reynolds says .\n“ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( Disney ) ended up being the most supportive partner you could ever imagine .\nThey were pretty gung-ho about making an original blockbuster film in the summertime .\n”",

         "'Tip of the iceberg': Report warns Michigan GOP ploy could shutter 20% of polling places. If successful , a Republican-backed petition initiative in Michigan could result in the closure of one in five polling locations across the crucial battleground state , potentially creating harmful new barriers to ballot access and disenfranchising voters .\nThat 's according to a report published Wednesday by the local advocacy group Progress Michigan , which warned that the election law changes proposed by the Secure MI Vote initiative would `` make it harder for Michiganders to vote and make the job of administering elections more difficult for local clerks . ''\nThe initiative proposes a slew of restrictive policies—from new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot distribution—but Progress Michigan 's report focuses on a provision that would bar state clerks from accepting in-kind contributions for activities related to election administration .\n`` While public buildings such as public schools and township halls are used as polling places , Michigan 's local clerks also make use of many nonprofit spaces , including places of worship , '' the report states .\n`` These nonprofit spaces are often donated and Secure MI Vote organizers have conceded this ballot provision would ban Michigan 's clerks from accepting donated spaces as polling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include a provision requiring the Michigan legislature—which is controlled by Republicans—to provide funding for local election clerks to pay for polling places that were previously donated .\nProgress Michigan estimates that around 664 of Michigan 's 3,355 total polling places for the 2020 election were churches , places of worship , or other similar religious spaces .\n`` Churches and similar places of worship account for the majority of nonprofit polling places and comprised approximately 20 % of all polling places for the 2020 election , '' the report notes .\n`` According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MI Vote ballot initiative would do away with polling places that have been used in communities for decades , and finding alternative locations could be incredibly difficult—if not impossible—and expensive to acquire . ''\nSam Inglot , deputy director of Progress Michigan , said in a statement that the report 's findings represent `` just the tip of the iceberg '' in terms of the potential harms of the Secure MI Vote initiative .\n`` This initiative will change where voters have voted in previous elections , in some cases for decades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling places available to voters , '' said Inglot .\n`` This systematic defunding of our elections will result in longer lines , longer drives , and less people able to make their voices heard . ''\nThe right-wing organizers of the Secure MI Vote initiative began collecting signatures for the measure last month , and it needs just over 340,000 signatures from registered voters to be taken up by Michigan 's GOP-controlled legislature—which will have the power to either adopt the proposal or put it on the ballot for voters to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure , Democratic Gov .\nGretchen Whitmer would be powerless to veto it .\n`` I hope people are able to see the danger and the impact of this proposal and refuse to sign it , '' said Mary Clark , president of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks and clerk of Delta Township .\n`` If this were to pass , I do n't know what I would do .\nI do n't know what other clerks would do . ''\n`` This is the type of policy that causes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause so much confusion amongst voters and put clerks in impossible situations , '' Clark added .\n`` This would absolutely negatively impact legally registered voters in my jurisdiction and every jurisdiction in this state . ''\nAnimated by former President Donald Trump 's `` Big Lie '' that the 2020 election was stolen , Michigan Republicans have attempted to ram through sweeping changes to the state 's election laws but have been rebuffed by Whitmer , who has vetoed several GOP-sponsored voter suppression bills in recent weeks .\nPresident Joe Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MLive reported last month , the Secure MI Vote initiative `` mirrors '' legislation that Republicans have failed to get past the governor 's desk .\n`` There is no doubt the goal of this proposal is to harm democracy , '' Barb Byrum , the clerk for Michigan 's Ingham County , told the local City Pulse on Wednesday .\n`` It is designed to put obstacles and hurdles between voters and the ballot box .

Major media outlets have been reporting that in late December 2020 , one of then-President Donald Trump 's loyalists in the U.S. Department of Justice , Jeffrey Clark , pursued a scheme for overturning the presidential election results in Georgia — and Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen , to his credit , flat-out refused to go along with it .\nBut Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is finding ways to defend Trump and blame Democrats , and journalist Steve Benen calls Grassley out in an op-ed published by NBC News ' website on August 10 .\nBenen explains , `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses toward the Justice Department , in particular , point to a profoundly important political scandal — about which congressional Republicans have said effectively nothing .\nIndeed , as investigations continue and new details emerge , the GOP 's silence becomes even more unsettling .\nThe good news is , Sen.

''\nAnd when he spoke on the Senate floor this week , the veteran senator said , `` This country has had to deal with the Democrats ' obsession with destroying Trump for much too long .\nIn the process , I fear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done and will do lasting damage to our country . ''\nIn response , Benen writes , `` Oh .\nSo , Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd overturn the results of an American presidential election ; he tried to use federal law enforcement as a political weapon to achieve his goals ; and he dispatched a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol in the hopes of disrupting the certification of a legitimate election .\nBut Chuck Grassley is concerned that Democrats might be responsible for doing 'lasting damage to our country .

''\nBenen notes that Clark , as acting head of the DOJ 's civil division , `` sketched out a map for Georgia Republicans to follow in which they could try to overturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ''\n`` We now know that the radical tactics and partisan extremists failed , '' Benen writes .\n`` But the fact that such a scheme was hatched in the first place is breathtaking — it looks an awful lot like an attempted coup — and it 's worth appreciating the fact that if there were a Republican majority in Congress right now , there would be no investigation into the scandal .

Gov .\nJohn Bel Edwards ran as a pro-gun Democrat back in 2015 , and since taking office the Louisiana governor has shied away from calling for bans on “ assault weapons ” and other restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms .\nStill , the governor showed voters this year that he ’ s not as much of a fan of the Second Amendment as he claimed when he vetoed a Constitutional Carry measure .\nWhat was originally a veto-proof majority in favor of the permitless carry bill turned into a narrow defeat for the measure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ’ d originally voted in favor of the legislation flip-flopped in the veto override session .\nEdwards may have hoped that the issue would die down once his veto had been sustained , but if so he was sorely mistaken .\nInstead , his veto has prompted at least two Louisiana parishes to declare themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries .\nIn the past week , both Grant and Rapides Parish have become what ’ s called a “ sanctuary parish ” for the second amendment , meaning the parish ’ s police juries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to bear arms .\nBoth of the local parishes decided to move forward with the designation in unanimous votes .\n“ We support the second amendment and we want our legislators and everyone in those lines and senators to also support our second amendment rights for our people up here , ” said Don Arnold , the Grant Parish Police Jury President .\nAccording to KALB-TV , there are now five Second Amendment sanctuaries in the state , though it ’ s unclear when the first three parishes took that step .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rapides parishes signing on , others are likely to follow suit .\nI have no idea how many parishes will be Second Amendment sanctuaries by the time the legislature begins its next legislative session , but I doubt it ’ s only going to be these five .\nAnd the more the 2A sanctuary movement spreads across the state , the harder it ’ s going to be for lawmakers to avoid the issue next session .\nWatching these developments got me thinking ; while I ’ m glad to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to fight the imposition of any new federal gun control laws , there are other steps that the five parishes ( and really , every Second Amendment sanctuary ) could take in the meantime to strengthen our Second Amendment rights .\nIn fact , in many ways it sounds like some of these parishes have already started .\nBoth Grant and Rapides have 4-H Shooting Sports programs already in place , for instance , which is fantastic .\nIt also looks like Grant Parish is in the process of building a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right direction .\nIt ’ s a relatively easy thing for a county board , city council , or a parish police jury to declare they ’ re a sanctuary for the Second Amendment , but it can also be an utterly meaningless declaration if there are no deeds to back up the thought .\nOne of the simplest things that Second Amendment sanctuaries can do to demonstrate their seriousness is to actively promote safe and responsible gun ownership .\nEncourage citizens to exercise their rights , and offer them educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their first steps into gun ownership .\nBring 4-H Shooting Sports programs and the JROTC to local schools .\nAdopt pro-range zoning policies , and build public ranges whenever possible , while encouraging the development of commercial ranges as well .\nA resolution defending the right to keep and bear arms is good .\nMaking those words matter is even better .",

         "Leftist Think Tank Makes Insane Link With Stolen Guns. Stolen guns represent a significant issue in American society .\nFor one thing , people whose guns are stolen are deprived of property they paid for .\nFor another , those guns end up in criminal hands .\nThis is a legitimate problem and we all know it .\nHowever , there ’ s not a lot of legislation that can really tackle this sort of thing .\nSome , however , would like for you to think otherwise .\nA new report has linked a change in a Missouri firearm law with an increase in the value of stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect measure of an increase in the number of stolen guns .\nThe study published Monday by researchers at the Center for American Progress , a left-leaning public policy group , analyzed federal data 12 years prior and 12 years after the state ’ s 2007 repeal of the requirement to obtain a permit to purchase a handgun .\nResearchers used federal data showing the values of stolen firearms reported to law enforcement agencies as a way to estimate the changes in the number of stolen firearms .\nAlthough the law ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention at the time , researchers have pointed to that one piece of legislation as a catalyst for the state ’ s deregulation of gun laws and have tied it to impacts on gun violence .\n“ ( The study ) shows that permit to purchase laws not only prevent gun suicides and homicides , but also contribute to gun thefts and the easy movement of guns across the state and beyond state , ” said Eugenio Weigend Vargas , director for gun violence prevention at the Center for American Progress .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ re going to make a claim about how the repeal of a purchase permit requirement led to more guns being stolen , you ’ d better damn well be able to show your work .\nAfter all , there ’ s absolutely no mechanism in any purchase permit requirement that will impact firearm thefts .\nYou might be able to argue that mandatory storage might reduce gun thefts , but that ’ s a separate policy that has nothing to do with purchase permits .\nThis is a prime example of how correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be if the correlation wasn ’ t questionable .\nSee , the problem is that they ’ re using a supposed valuation of stolen guns as a proxy for actual numbers .\nThe thing is , how can you accurately gauge the value of stolen guns without knowing the number of guns stolen .\nFurther , even if you somehow had an accurate valuation , one particularly expensive firearm can skew those results .\nAfter all , the theft of one Alvin White ’ s Colt New Frontier ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a much higher valuation than 1,000 Hi-Points , yet which is more likely to be a problem on our nation ’ s streets ?\nFrankly , using the valuation of stolen guns is a bad metric anyway , but I suspect I know what it was used here .\nIt was used because it allows the Center for American Progress to use numbers that aren ’ t easily rebuked or refuted to make their case .\nNone of which , however , has any impact on the fact that requiring people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun has any relevance on whether that firearm is later stolen or not .\nIt just doesn ’ t .\nEspecially since it wasn ’ t exactly difficult to get a permit to buy a gun in the first place .\nFor an anti-gun organization , I expect something that should at least sound plausible .\nThis ain ’ t it .",

         "First-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons enters into force. First-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons enters into force The first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons has entered into force and is being hailed as a historic step to rid the world of its deadliest weapons UNITED NATIONS -- The first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons entered into force on Friday , hailed as a historic step to rid the world of its deadliest weapons but strongly opposed by the world 's nuclear-armed nations .\nThe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is now part of international law , culminating a decades-long campaign aimed at preventing a repetition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagasaki at the end of World War II .\nBut getting all nations to ratify the treaty requiring them to never own such weapons seems daunting , if not impossible , in the current global climate .\nWhen the treaty was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in July 2017 , more than 120 approved it .\nBut none of the nine countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons — the United States , Russia , Britain , China , France , India , Pakistan , North Korea and Israel — supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance .\nJapan , the world 's only country to suffer nuclear attacks , also does not support the treaty , even though the aged survivors of the bombings in 1945 strongly push for it to do so .\nJapan on its own renounces use and possession of nuclear weapons , but the government has said pursuing a treaty ban is not realistic with nuclear and non-nuclear states so sharply divided over it .\nNonetheless , Beatrice Fihn , executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons , the 2017 Nobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty , called it “ a really big day for international law , for the United Nations and for survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n” The treaty received its 50th ratification on Oct. 24 , triggering a 90-day period before its entry into force on Jan. 22 .\nAs of Thursday , Fihn told The Associated Press that 61 countries had ratified the treaty , with another ratification possible on Friday , and “ from Friday , nuclear weapons will be banned by international law ” in all those countries .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never under any circumstances ... develop , test , produce , manufacture , otherwise acquire , possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n” It also bans any transfer or use of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices — and the threat to use such weapons — and requires parties to promote the treaty to other countries .\nFihn said the treaty is “ really , really significant ” because it will now be a key legal instrument , along with the Geneva Conventions on conduct toward civilians and soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biological weapons and land mines .\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the treaty demonstrated support for multilateral approaches to nuclear disarmament .\n“ Nuclear weapons pose growing dangers and the world needs urgent action to ensure their elimination and prevent the catastrophic human and environmental consequences any use would cause , ” he said in a video message .\n“ The elimination of nuclear weapons remains the highest disarmament priority of the United Nations.\n” But not for the nuclear powers .\nAs the treaty was approaching the 50 ratifications needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump administration wrote a letter to countries that signed it saying they made “ a strategic error ” and urging them to rescind their ratification .\nThe letter said the treaty “ turns back the clock on verification and disarmament '' and would endanger the half-century-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , considered the cornerstone of nonproliferation efforts .\nFihn countered at the time that a ban could not undermine nonproliferation since it was `` the end goal of the Nonproliferation Treaty.\n” Daryl Kimball , executive director of the Arms Control Association , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic step forward in efforts to free the world of nuclear weapons and “ hopefully will compel renewed action by nuclear-weapon states to fulfill their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.\n” Fihn said in an interview that the campaign sees strong public support for the treaty in NATO countries and growing political pressure , citing Belgium and Spain .\n“ We will not stop until we get everyone on board , ” she said .\nIt will also be campaigning for divestment — pressuring financial institutions to stop giving capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nuclear weapons and missile production including Airbus , Boeing and Lockheed Martin .",

It was n't Lin-Manuel Miranda 's idea to appear on screen in `` In the Heights , '' the jubilant new movie adaptation of his 2008 Tony Award-winning musical — the Broadway hit that paved the way for `` Hamilton . ''\nHe says he would have been happy sitting in his writer 's chair and cheering on the cast filming in his own neighborhood .\nBut he was persuaded to take on the small role of Piragüero , who pushes a cart selling shaved ice with fruit-flavored syrups , thanks to the film 's screenplay writer , Quiara Alegría @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , '' Miranda told CBS News .\n`` 'If you 're in it , it 's the surest way the song does n't get cut , ' '' he recalled her suggesting during a pre-production meeting with director Jon M.

''\nRamos previously played Usnavi in a production of `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C. '' He 's a better Usnavi than I could ever be , honestly , '' Miranda admitted .\n`` He has an incredible skill set that seems to have no ceiling .

''\nAt first , he said he `` did n't have the courage '' to look at the story differently , but Quiara did .\n`` She said , 'You started this whole thing .\nLet me take a stab at it .\nI think I 'll be braver in terms of adapting this thing that we have co-parented for our entire 20s , ' '' Miranda recalled of getting to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular that was cut almost immediately was a reference to former President Donald Trump in the song `` 96,000 , '' which originally went : '' When I wrote that lyric in 2005 , he was a reality TV host , '' not a politician , Miranda said .\n`` He was just sort of like the human version of the Monopoly man when I was growing up .

Major media outlets have been reporting that in late December 2020 , one of then-President Donald Trump 's loyalists in the U.S. Department of Justice , Jeffrey Clark , pursued a scheme for overturning the presidential election results in Georgia — and Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen , to his credit , flat-out refused to go along with it .\nBut Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is finding ways to defend Trump and blame Democrats , and journalist Steve Benen calls Grassley out in an op-ed published by NBC News ' website on August 10 .\nBenen explains , `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses toward the Justice Department , in particular , point to a profoundly important political scandal — about which congressional Republicans have said effectively nothing .\nIndeed , as investigations continue and new details emerge , the GOP 's silence becomes even more unsettling .\nThe good news is , Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee ( and its former chairman ) , delivered floor remarks on the ongoing controversy .\nThe bad news is , the Iowa Republican is taking Trump 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its verdict in Trump 's second impeachment trial in February , Grassley voted `` not guilty . ''\nAnd when he spoke on the Senate floor this week , the veteran senator said , `` This country has had to deal with the Democrats ' obsession with destroying Trump for much too long .\nIn the process , I fear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done and will do lasting damage to our country . ''\nIn response , Benen writes , `` Oh .\nSo , Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd overturn the results of an American presidential election ; he tried to use federal law enforcement as a political weapon to achieve his goals ; and he dispatched a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol in the hopes of disrupting the certification of a legitimate election .\nBut Chuck Grassley is concerned that Democrats might be responsible for doing 'lasting damage to our country . '\n'' Grassley told fellow U.S. senators , `` The president has every right to discuss ideas and strategy with his closest advisors . ''\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trump was n't just kicking around legal concepts in the Oval Office , as if he were a college sophomore in a dorm room after an engaging Philosophy 101 lecture .\nA sitting American president pressed leading government officials to help him undermine our democracy .\nIt 's the sort of thing senators should have a problem with . ''\nBenen notes that Clark , as acting head of the DOJ 's civil division , `` sketched out a map for Georgia Republicans to follow in which they could try to overturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ''\n`` We now know that the radical tactics and partisan extremists failed , '' Benen writes .\n`` But the fact that such a scheme was hatched in the first place is breathtaking — it looks an awful lot like an attempted coup — and it 's worth appreciating the fact that if there were a Republican majority in Congress right now , there would be no investigation into the scandal .

         "First-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons enters into force. First-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons enters into force The first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons has entered into force and is being hailed as a historic step to rid the world of its deadliest weapons UNITED NATIONS -- The first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons entered into force on Friday , hailed as a historic step to rid the world of its deadliest weapons but strongly opposed by the world 's nuclear-armed nations .\nThe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is now part of international law , culminating a decades-long campaign aimed at preventing a repetition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nagasaki at the end of World War II .\nBut getting all nations to ratify the treaty requiring them to never own such weapons seems daunting , if not impossible , in the current global climate .\nWhen the treaty was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in July 2017 , more than 120 approved it .\nBut none of the nine countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons — the United States , Russia , Britain , China , France , India , Pakistan , North Korea and Israel — supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance .\nJapan , the world 's only country to suffer nuclear attacks , also does not support the treaty , even though the aged survivors of the bombings in 1945 strongly push for it to do so .\nJapan on its own renounces use and possession of nuclear weapons , but the government has said pursuing a treaty ban is not realistic with nuclear and non-nuclear states so sharply divided over it .\nNonetheless , Beatrice Fihn , executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons , the 2017 Nobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty , called it “ a really big day for international law , for the United Nations and for survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n” The treaty received its 50th ratification on Oct. 24 , triggering a 90-day period before its entry into force on Jan. 22 .\nAs of Thursday , Fihn told The Associated Press that 61 countries had ratified the treaty , with another ratification possible on Friday , and “ from Friday , nuclear weapons will be banned by international law ” in all those countries .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never under any circumstances ... develop , test , produce , manufacture , otherwise acquire , possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n” It also bans any transfer or use of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices — and the threat to use such weapons — and requires parties to promote the treaty to other countries .\nFihn said the treaty is “ really , really significant ” because it will now be a key legal instrument , along with the Geneva Conventions on conduct toward civilians and soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biological weapons and land mines .\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the treaty demonstrated support for multilateral approaches to nuclear disarmament .\n“ Nuclear weapons pose growing dangers and the world needs urgent action to ensure their elimination and prevent the catastrophic human and environmental consequences any use would cause , ” he said in a video message .\n“ The elimination of nuclear weapons remains the highest disarmament priority of the United Nations.\n” But not for the nuclear powers .\nAs the treaty was approaching the 50 ratifications needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump administration wrote a letter to countries that signed it saying they made “ a strategic error ” and urging them to rescind their ratification .\nThe letter said the treaty “ turns back the clock on verification and disarmament '' and would endanger the half-century-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , considered the cornerstone of nonproliferation efforts .\nFihn countered at the time that a ban could not undermine nonproliferation since it was `` the end goal of the Nonproliferation Treaty.\n” Daryl Kimball , executive director of the Arms Control Association , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic step forward in efforts to free the world of nuclear weapons and “ hopefully will compel renewed action by nuclear-weapon states to fulfill their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.\n” Fihn said in an interview that the campaign sees strong public support for the treaty in NATO countries and growing political pressure , citing Belgium and Spain .\n“ We will not stop until we get everyone on board , ” she said .\nIt will also be campaigning for divestment — pressuring financial institutions to stop giving capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nuclear weapons and missile production including Airbus , Boeing and Lockheed Martin .",

It was n\\'t Lin-Manuel Miranda \\'s idea to appear on screen in `` In the Heights , \\'\\' the jubilant new movie adaptation of his 2008 Tony Award-winning musical — the Broadway hit that paved the way for `` Hamilton . \\'\\'\\nHe says he would have been happy sitting in his writer \\'s chair and cheering on the cast filming in his own neighborhood .\\nBut he was persuaded to take on the small role of Piragüero , who pushes a cart selling shaved ice with fruit-flavored syrups , thanks to the film \\'s screenplay writer , Quiara Alegría @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , \\'\\' Miranda told CBS News .\\n`` \\'If you \\'re in it , it \\'s the surest way the song does n\\'t get cut , \\' \\'\\' he recalled her suggesting during a pre-production meeting with director Jon M. Chu .\\nThe character \\'s song , `` Piragua , \\'\\' is n\\'t essential to the plot , which is why he worried it could face the chopping block .\\nBut Miranda sees it as key to what the movie , a love letter to his Washington Heights community set during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n`` It \\'s a metaphor for the entire neighborhood : Life is hard .\\nPrices are going up , but we keep scraping by , \\'\\' explained Miranda .\\nWhen `` In the Heights \\'\\' first premiered at the Richard Rodgers Theatre — the same stage where `` Hamilton \\'\\' will reopen after an 18-month pandemic shutdown on September 14 — Miranda , an unknown rising talent full of energy , made his Broadway debut on two fronts .\\nHe not only wrote the music and lyrics alongside Hudes , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usnavi , the young bodega owner seeking a better life .\\nIt earned him his first two Tony nominations and a win for Best Original Score .\\nThe role of Usnavi , which Miranda , now 41 , aged out of , is played in the film by Anthony Ramos , the actor who played John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the original cast of `` Hamilton \\'\\' on Broadway .\\nMiranda said one of the most joyous days on set for him was filming a duet with Ramos of the song `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n\\'t gotten Ramos \\' pre-recorded tracks yet , so they had to lip-sync to the original Broadway cast album featuring Miranda \\'s own voice as Usnavi .\\n`` So I was dueting with the voice of myself while staring into my \\'Hamilton \\' son \\'s eyes .\\nI mean , I will be unpacking this for years , \\'\\' he said of the memorable scene — which ended with him `` crying my eyes out \\'\\' when Chu said `` cut . \\'\\'\\nRamos previously played Usnavi in a production of `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C. \\'\\' He \\'s a better Usnavi than I could ever be , honestly , \\'\\' Miranda admitted .\\n`` He has an incredible skill set that seems to have no ceiling . \\'\\'\\nMiranda is being modest , as his talents seem to have no ceiling either .\\nHe is co-author of a new book , `` In The Heights : Finding Home , \\'\\' about the making of the musical and film .\\nThe book is set to be released on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the movie opens in theaters nationwide on Thursday , June 10 , while simultaneously streaming on HBO Max .\\nIt also coincides with the reopening of the 104-year-old independent Drama Book Shop , which Miranda bought in 2019 with Tommy Kail , the director of `` Heights \\'\\' and `` Hamilton \\'\\' on Broadway , to rescue from likely demise .\\nMiranda has said he wrote many of the `` Heights \\'\\' songs in the shop \\'s basement .\\nThe store , now at a new location near Times Square , opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` In the Heights \\'\\' has had a special place in Miranda \\'s heart since he started working on it in college .\\nIn 1999 , as a sophomore at Wesleyan University in Connecticut , Miranda drafted the first pages of the musical .\\nThis early version was not for course credit , he told Entertainment Tonight at the `` Heights \\'\\' 10th anniversary reunion celebration in 2018 .\\n`` I just really needed to write it , \\'\\' he said of putting a story about his neighborhood to paper and wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n`` This [ story ] was manifested from Lin , when he first decided that he did n\\'t have roles for himself .\\nSo he wrote it for himself .\\nHe wrote it for his community , \\'\\' said Chu , who also directed the 2018 box office hit `` Crazy Rich Asians . \\'\\'\\n`` In the

@ @ @ @ silver screen were announced , with Miranda tapped to reprise his role as Usnavi at the time .\\nBut it took a decade of setbacks and delays before production finally began .\\nUpdates , new

when you write for Usnavi and Vanessa and they \\'re having a new moment , it \\'s more like taking dictation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they \\'ll say , \\'\\' Miranda said .\\n`` It was a joy to revisit them again . \\'\\'\\nAt first , he said he `` did n\\'t have the courage \\'\\' to look at the story differently , but Quiara did .\\n`` She said , \\'You started this whole thing .\\nLet me take a stab at it .\\nI think I \\'ll be braver in terms of adapting this thing that we have co-parented for our entire 20s , \\' \\'\\' Miranda recalled of getting to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular that was cut almost immediately was a reference to former President Donald Trump in the song `` 96,000 , \\'\\' which originally went : \\'\\' When I wrote that lyric in 2005 , he was a reality TV host ,

instead of Donald Trump .\\nSince the Trump presidency began in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting on the show asked for permission to rework that line .\\n`` When his name came to be associated with some of the most divisive , hateful rhetoric at Latino people that I think we \\'ve had from an administration , you know , obviously , the connotation just changes , it just had no business being in that song , \\'\\' he said .\\nAnother lyric about immigration , sung by the character Sonny ( Gregory Diaz IV ) , still deeply resonates with Miranda : \\'\\' How much more true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was in 2008 ?\\nObviously the immigration debate has been with us for decades but I do believe it \\'s coarsened and the discourse around it has gotten so toxic , \\'\\' he said .\\nThe struggles , joys and sorrows of Latino immigrants in the U.S. are at the forefront of cinema this year .\\nSteven Spielberg \\'s reimagining of `` West Side Story \\'\\' — a take on Romeo and Juliet — is scheduled to

`` Heights \\'\\' shots . )\\n`` I was proud that all these Latinx dancers and performers were getting opportunities to show off who they were , \\'\\' said Chu .\\nMiranda , whose passion for musical theater was inspired by classics like `` West Side Story , \\'\\' hopes that `` In the Heights , \\'\\' which showcases his culture and his neighborhood , resonates with audiences nationwide .\\n`` @

''\\nFury had to undergo a lengthy quarantine on his return to the UK so he could be with Paris when she had baby Athena on 8 August .\\nThe fighter released a heartfelt message when Athena had to spend time in intensive care .\\n`` It 's a stressful time , babies and complications , '' Fury said , but he downplayed the effect it might have on his preparations for Wilder .\\n`` Camp is usual , I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .\\n`` I 've been training myself like in the Rocky movie .\\nLike I said , what I do n't know about boxing ai n't worth knowing . ''\\nFrank Warren linked up with Fury when he was at his home in Morecambe and offered a positive insight into the heavyweight 's mindset after such a stressful time .\\n`` The only concern I had was when his daughter was in trouble , '' Fury 's co-promoter said .\\n`` It was quite awful times .\\nWith the baby , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\n`` When I saw him in person he was in a tremendous place .\\nPhysically there was a problem before where he would balloon up between fights - he 's fixed that problem .\\nMentally he 's now on the money .\\nWhen he 's like that , he 's a dangerous guy in the ring .

       "  'Blackhawks’ Ian Mitchell experiencing growing pains through his first 8 NHL games. The Blackhawks ’ brass talked all fall about how the team ’ s young players would endure ups and downs in their development .\\nThrough the first training camp and eight NHL games of his career , that certainly has been the case for much-hyped defenseman Ian Mitchell .\\nJanuary started high for Mitchell but is on track to finish a little low .\\nThat ’ s the reality of nonlinear growth .\\n‘ ‘ [ There ’ s ] lots to learn , but I think I ’ ve played pretty well these first six games , ’ ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Hawks ’ back-to-back this week against the Predators .\\n‘ ‘ I ’ d say a lot more good than bad to start .\\nDefinitely a lot of positive things to build on for the rest of the season.\\n’ ’ The ensuing back-to-back was especially tough for Mitchell , however .\\nThe Predators ’ tight-checking , defense-first system operates a bit differently than those of most teams — although the Blue Jackets , the Hawks ’ opponent on Friday and Sunday , are relatively comparable — and it gave Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed numerous turnovers trying to exit the defensive zone .\\nThe nifty passes up the middle or to the inside often look good for a split-second and worked well against the porous Red Wings , but they were picked off regularly by the positionally sound Predators .\\nSafer chips up the boards would have worked better in many cases .\\nThat led to the Hawks spending far too much time pinned in their own end instead of moving the puck up the ice and into the offensive zone , where Mitchell is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We defended pretty well ; we just defended too much , ’ ’ coach Jeremy Colliton said Wednesday about the first game of the back-to-back Tuesday .\\nThe same was true for Wednesday .\\nMitchell was on the ice for Roman Josi ’ s overtime winner Tuesday .\\nHis lackadaisical offensive-zone turnover a dozen seconds earlier gave the Predators possession , even though a miscommunication between Dylan Strome and Patrick Kane in coverage was far more to blame .\\nMitchell then played a season-low 9 minutes , 47 seconds Wednesday , despite seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his career .\\nThe Hawks dressed seven defensemen for the game , so a slight reduction was to be expected , but Mitchell played even less than Lucas Carlsson ( 11:50 ) and Nicolas Beaudin ( 9:50 ) .\\nThrough eight games , Mitchell has been on the ice for 40 scoring chances for and 51 against during five-on-five play , a 44.0 % ratio that ranks 15th among 22 Hawks .\\nThe high-danger chances tell an even more lopsided story ( six for , 20 against ) , as do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\\nThe biggest reason for those poor results isn ’ t lack of talent but lack of experience .\\nGetting a feel for the quality and pace of play in the NHL and adjusting one ’ s game to those standards is a slow process .\\nJosi , Steven Stamkos and Dylan Larkin — three of the players who have scored against Mitchell so far — are a lot tougher competition than the players he faced last season at the University of Denver .\\n‘ ‘ When you go up against good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make plays sometimes , ’ ’ Mitchell said .\\n‘ ‘ I ’ m just trying to learn how good the best players in the league are .\\nThat ’ s been the biggest thing for me : just learning and adjusting to that .\\nI ’ ve definitely been on the wrong side of them a couple of times , but I ’ m learning , too.\\n’ ’ Mitchell ’ s heavy emphasis on learning is correct .\\nHe said Colliton and assistant coaches Sheldon Brookbank and Tomas Mitell have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has received video of his shifts to review upon returning to the hotel each night .\\nThis 2021 season is most about developing the Hawks ’ young players , and Mitchell is one of the most important of them .\\nThat is happening , but there will be some bumps along the way .'],\n",

Robinson , or George Raft , even if their characters did die in the end ?\\nFinally , when it came to overt sexuality , Hitchock was the master at conveying eroticism and sexual passion within the confines of the Production Code .\\nWhat I ’ m saying is that the Production Code only restricted how something could be conveyed .\\nIt did not restrict content .\\nAnd I believe the movies from that era are better for it .\\nSubtext is almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main point… No topic was off limits under the old Production Code , and this is definitely not the case under today ’ s Woke Gestapo Production Code , which is strangling today ’ s artists and their art .\\nUndoubtedly , this is what Glover is talking about… Present-day movies and television are boring because today ’ s restrictions are so narrow and stifling , not to mention intensely regulated .\\nEveryone ’ s terrified to color outside the lines , to push the envelope for fear of being blacklisted ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get are movies and television shows that all look and sound alike .\\nSexuality is verboten ( unless it ’ s gay sex ) .\\nEverything ’ s maddeningly sterile .\\nLook at Marvel movies .\\nThey ’ re so asexual it ’ s absurd .\\nBut under the Woke Gestapo Production Code , women do not need men , so Hulk and Black Widow aren ’ t allowed to get it on .\\nAfter that first movie , even Iron Man was neutered .\\nHow do you work around an edict that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ?\\nYou can ’ t .\\nIt is what it is .\\nSo no more sex , no more sexuality , no more romance — three things that have always been the backbone of storytelling .\\nThe Woke Gestapo Production Code also ensures racial minorities and women can only be portrayed in a certain way , same with homosexuals and illegal aliens , etc .\\nWorse still , these characters must hold the “ correct ” beliefs and engage in overt virtue signaling .\\nSorry , but that ’ s not art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Production Code demands certain things be acknowledged… The fairy tale of “ systemic racism , ” colonialism , female agency , etc .\\nWhen you have rules in place outlawing content ( something the old Production Code did not do ) , as well as rules requiring certain people be portrayed only this way and that certain messages be included , what you get is anti-art , and the result is sameness , is something generic , dull , and predictable – like the new Star Wars trilogy .\\nYou are also taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messaging ; the spell is broken , which , in my mind is the biggest sin a storyteller can commit .\\nSo , yeah , Donald Glover sounds frustrated , which isn ’ t surprising given that he ’ s both an actor and musician .\\nImagine trying to write an interesting television show under the unforgiving eye of the Woke Gestapo , or trying to write an interesting song ?\\nIt ’ s impossible and the results are all over your TV .\\nI ’ ve gotten to a point where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new television shows because I know they ’ re all going to offer the same woke crap .\\nThe Sopranos , Breaking Bad , The Shield , Game of Thrones , The Wire… Those shows were all-timers because they never stopped surprising us , but those shows came in under the wire when television was still allowed to be unpredictable and complicated .\\nCan you imagine The Sopranos attempting to survive under today ’ s suffocating environment or the artistic compromises that would have been forced on its creators ?\\nIt ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nHopefully more will join him , but I fear that like most moral panics , this one will take a generation to work itself out .\\nIn the meantime , thank God we have DVD , we have access to decades of television and movies produced during a time when artists were still bold , unafraid , and above all , honest in their portrayals of the endlessly fascinating and complicated human condition .\"],\n",

As of January 2021 , 92.6 % of all users ( 4.32 billion people ) accessed the Internet via mobile devices — which is why a reliable and strong Wi-Fi connection is extremely important for many .\\nThat said , no one wants to deal with the headache of losing a connection in the middle of an important meeting or while watching your favorite Netflix show .\\nThat ’ s why we at Bright Side want to present you with 7 tips to ensure your Wi-Fi signal stays strong and reliable when you need it most .\\nTry these tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly .\\nBefore trying anything fancy , it ’ s better to stick to the basics .\\nFirst , run an Internet speed test — that ’ s the best way to determine if you are getting the speed you are paying for .\\nTo get the most trustworthy results , you should take these steps : • Get an Ethernet cable ( the most common type of cable used to connect 2 wired devices to ensure Internet connection ) .\\n• Connect one end of the cable to your modem and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the measured speed is not as advertised , it is best to contact your Internet provider and work out a solution .\\nPlease note : You could run the test using a wireless signal , but the results won ’ t be precise .\\nThe placement of your router is crucial for the signal you ’ re getting .\\nThe rule of thumb is to put the router in a central location in the house , not obstructed by walls , refrigerators ( or other electronics ) , fish tanks , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your box in a dark corner of the house .\\nBut if you give your router enough room to “ breathe ” ( literally give it enough open-air ) , you will definitely ensure a better Wi-Fi signal .\\nThere ’ s actually an app that can help you find the best placement for your router in the house .\\n3 .\\nAdjust the antennas on the router .\\nLet ’ s say your router has 2 antennas .\\nWhat ’ s the best direction to put them in ?\\nBasically , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the signal spreads horizontally .\\nAnd if the antenna is pointing horizontally , the signal is emitted vertically .\\nSo it really depends on your particular situation .\\nIf your home or office is single-story , the best decision is to place the antennas vertically

This month is the 50th anniversary of National Public Radio ( NPR ) .\\nKnowing about my work back then with other advocates , to persuade Congress to pass legislation creating NPR and PBS , ( which was opposed by most of the commercial radio/TV industry ) , a friend asked what I think of NPR now .\\nA few observations , drawn from listening to NPR largely over the WAMC station in Albany , New York during a Covid-19 year , are in order .\\n• I find the features and the collaboration with other investigative groups , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One piece about Amazon 's warehouses was especially memorable .\\nMoreover , Scott Simon and David Brancaccio are so capable as to be considered under-challenged .\\n• NPR 's top-of-the-hour news amounts to little more than three minutes .\\nIt is repetitious and basically a minor headline service .\\nThis mimicking of commercial network radio news is not what we envisioned 50 years ago .\\nThe prolonged 6:15 pm evening weather forecasts on WAMC are often longer than the evening news briefs at 6:00 pm .\\n• There is just too much weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around mid-day , they 'll tell you about the weather in California and the mountain states before you hear the forecast for the local listening region .\\nThey even promote the weather forecasts .\\nSo obsessed are they that they repeat the forecast over the four adjoining regions they service preceded by an overall forecast .\\nThink of the additional local news that could be reported instead .\\n• The public radio/TV legislation from Congress did not envision advertisements .\\nPublic funding , audience , and foundation donations were seen as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public institution , inspired in part by the more extensive BBC and CBC in the UK and Canada .\\n• What started as a `` just a little bit of commercial sponsorship , '' when Congress got tight some years ago , has now gone wild .\\nDo we really need to be reminded that `` support for this station ( or for NPR ) comes from x , y , z contributors , '' about thirty times an hour ?\\nMind-numbing , hour after hour !\\nNPR makes sure to identify corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doing reports affecting these companies .\\nBut top NPR management defiantly refuses to monitor the corporate character or respect for the law of these and other companies before they give them NPR 's credibility .\\nThe Corporate Crime Reporter provided NPR management with a list of law violations , such as those by Raymond James , an NPR `` sponsor '' pursuant to asking about any of NPR 's Ad monitoring .\\nNPR boss , the usually incommunicado John Lansing , essentially blew off the inquiry , saying there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience .\\n• A key reason for Congress creating NPR was to have its affiliates fill local news gaps , largely neglected by the commercial stations .\\nWAMC has spent good money hiring local reporters in upstate eastern New York , western Massachusetts , and Vermont who know and stay on the beat .\\nBut national NPR has spent far too much time on entertainment subjects and interviews and not enough time on civic events , reports , and movements , aside from issues of race , gender , and police violence being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPR 's daily birthday announcement almost always features entertainment or professional sports figures .\\nNational civic , labor or educational leaders are scarcely noted .\\n• More civic news suffers not for lack of time .\\nNPR and affiliates offer plenty of hours for music .\\nForget about Saturday and Sunday evenings .\\nAt some NPR affiliates , 6:00 pm on weekends is sign-off time in favor of entertainment time .\\n• NPR often describes the personal plight of people in poverty or suffering from other deprivations , but rarely probes the structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in creating the problems .\\nIncreasingly , corporate power is shaping an evermore dominant corporate state that allows mercantile values to seriously weaken the social fabric and moral norms of our society .\\nNot many NPR reporters use words like `` corporate crime , '' `` corporate welfare , '' or cover the corporate capturing of agencies , the vast unaudited military budget , or many other realms of American life controlled by `` corporatism .

Thursday could be a big day .\\nOn March 4 , Donald Trump will be triumphantly returned to power to help save the world from a shadowy syndicate of Satan-worshipping pedophiles – or at least that is what a small fraction of American citizens believe .\\nBut before you circle the date and dust off the MAGA hats , a note of caution : We have been here before .\\nAdherents of the same conspiracy theory , QAnon , had previously marked Jan. 20 , the day of Joe Biden 's inauguration , as the big day .\\nAs Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the presidential oath of office , tens of thousands of adherents of QAnon were eagerly awaiting the imminent arrest and execution of Democratic politicians in a “ storm '' that would upend the social and political order .\\nIt did n't happen .\\nIn the aftermath of this disappointment , some disillusioned QAnon followers left the fold .\\nBut as evidenced by the new date of March 4 – chosen because it was the day for presidential inaugurations until the 20th Amendment was adopted in 1933 – some hardliners claimed they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – or if – that date too passes without incident , a new date may emerge .\\nIt might be thought that enough failed predictions would eventually discredit a prophet .\\nBut as a philosopher of religion , I know history suggests a more complicated set of possibilities .\\nApocalyptic movements rarely simply dissolve when prophecies are seen to fail .\\nIndeed , such crises have in the past presented believers with fertile opportunities to reinterpret prophecies .\\nThey have even strengthened movements , giving rise to new theories that attempt to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic played out nearly 180 years ago with the Millerites , members of a 19th-century evangelical Christian movement who were part of an earlier “ Great Awakening '' in U.S. religious history .\\nA Baptist preacher , William Miller drew on biblical texts and numerology to predict the imminent second coming of Christ .\\nAlthough Miller did not initially claim to know the exact date , he and his followers offered various predictions .\\nAs each passed without incident , the Millerites redid the Biblical math to propose new dates , until finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1844 .\\nAs the expected second advent drew near , many Millerites gave away their possessions in anticipation of Christ 's return .\\nWhen Oct. 22 came and went without incident , the Millerites were left to reconstruct a worldview that acknowledged what came to be called the “ Great Disappointment . ''\\nMiller 's followers concluded not that the Scriptures and numerology on which they had based their predictions were false , but simply that they had misunderstood their meaning .\\nIn one view , what the predictions foretold were not earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not collapse ; rather , elements of it were central to the establishment of Seventh Day Adventism , a rapidly growing Protestant denomination that continues to look forward to Christ 's return .\\nLooking at how the Millerites dealt with their Great Disappointment gives an insight into how believers navigate what the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre calls “ epistemological crises . ''\\nThese are moments when the way someone understands the world is thrown into question by events that do n't fit expectations .\\nEpistemological crises are not unique to religion .\\nAnyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or felt the rug pulled out from under them when unexpectedly fired by an employer , knows that they are a fact of life .\\nSuch a crisis undercuts a person 's ability to tell the kind of story about themselves that gives order and meaning to life .\\nLeft unresolved , it threatens one 's understanding of oneself and others .\\nYet , such crises do n't always prove insurmountable .\\nMacIntyre writes , “ When an epistemological crisis is resolved , it is by the construction of a new narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both how he or she could intelligibly have held his or her original beliefs and how he or she could have been so drastically misled by them . ''\\nSometimes the new understanding repudiates the old .\\nOften , however , the new narrative is not a radical departure from the old one , but an improvised and more sophisticated version of it – one that incorporates what had earlier seemed like outlying data points .\\nThe Millerites , for example , survived their Great Disappointment by reaffirming their belief that God is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always fully anticipate .\\nWriting in the mid-20th century , the philosopher Antony Flew suggested that over time , religious beliefs “ die the death of a thousand qualifications . ''\\nThat is , they are modified beyond recognition , to the point of meaninglessness .\\nBut scholars of religion have documented a pattern in which , rather than dying , fringe beliefs evolve , becoming more socially acceptable .\\nAs they are gradually disentangled from politics , they come to be thought of as more truly “ religious . ''\\nWhether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past great disappointments depends in part on the interpretive tools available within the group and the ingenuity of adherents in explaining away their own unfulfilled expectations .\\nIt is anyone 's guess whether QAnon will survive its current epistemological crisis .\\nAnd if it does , there is no guarantee that it will emerge chastened .\\nSome commentators have predicted that it will return even more dangerous than before , evolving into increasingly virulent strains .\\nIt may well be subsumed within a larger conspiracy theory that seeks to explain the current disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate narrative .\\nPerhaps one day QAnon will take its place within the domesticated pantheon of American civil religion as another benign and depoliticized “ faith . ''\\nThen again , it may simply sputter out , dying the death of a thousand qualifications .\\nBut if history is any guide , whether QAnon survives its Great Disappointment will depend on its adherents ' ability to successfully explain to themselves how they could have been so drastically misled .\\n[ Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation 's newsletter to understand the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amesbury , Professor of Religious Studies and of Philosophy and Director of the School of Historical , Philosophical and Religious Studies , Arizona State University This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license .\\nRead the original article .\",\n",

         "Senate Republicans Pressure Joe Biden to Withdraw Ecoterrorism-Linked Nominee",
         "Several congressional Republicans are expressing their public opposition to President Joe Biden ’ s nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) over her past ties to ecoterrorist activity .\nSen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) , who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , the committee that will vote on Tracy Stone-Manning ’ s nomination ahead of a full Senate vote , said he plans to object to the nomination .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists who had booby trapped trees with metal spikes .\n… She did not cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Barrasso said in a statement .\nSen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P. Blount who was sentenced to 17 months in prison for tree spiking .\nFormer BLM Acting Director William Perry Pendley detailed in an op-ed with Breitbart News how Stone-Manning ’ s testimony came in exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed a profane letter Blount had given her to the U.S. Forest Service warning of trees that had been spiked .\nStone-Manning , who around the same timeframe was a member of the radical environmentalist group Earth First !\n— which engaged in ecoterrorism — had initially been subpoenaed in 1989 over the tree spiking case .\nPendley wrote : Tree spiking is the act of installing metal spikes into trees , creating a dangerous or even deadly scenario for loggers should their saw come into contact with the spikes .\nTree spiking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a federal crime .\nPendley noted Stone-Manning also admitted to the Missoulian in 1993 that she could have been charged with conspiracy , just as others had been , if it were not for her immunity agreement .\nIn a questionnaire for her Senate committee hearing , Stone-Manning claimed she was never the subject of a criminal investigation and that the tree spiking case to which she is linked was merely “ alleged ” tree spiking — despite the facts that she was a target in the 1989 grand jury investigation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1993 interview that she would have been charged with conspiracy in the tree spiking crime if it were not for her immunity agreement , and the crime did occur and the individuals she testified against were convicted for it .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning lied to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by claiming the tree spiking was ‘ alleged ’ and that she was never investigated , ” Barrasso asserted .\n“ Now , we have confirmation that neither of those things are true .\nPresident Biden must withdraw her nomination.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive portion of which is in Alaska .\nSen. Dan Sullivan ( R-AK ) voiced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a lengthy statement last week as he emphasized the magnitude of the bureau ’ s influence over his state .\nSullivan called her nomination “ shocking , ” and the state ’ s senior senator , Sen.

Several congressional Republicans are expressing their public opposition to President Joe Biden ’ s nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) over her past ties to ecoterrorist activity .\nSen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) , who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , the committee that will vote on Tracy Stone-Manning ’ s nomination ahead of a full Senate vote , said he plans to object to the nomination .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists who had booby trapped trees with metal spikes .\n… She did not cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Barrasso said in a statement .\nSen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P.

A federal judge has suspended South Carolina from enforcing a rule that banned school districts from requiring masks for students COLUMBIA , S.C. -- A federal judge Tuesday suspended South Carolina from enforcing a rule that banned school districts from requiring masks for students .\nParents of disabled children , helped by the American Civil Liberties Union , sued the state saying the ban discriminated against medically vulnerable students by keeping them out of public schools as the COVID-19 pandemic continues .\nThe mask ban has been forcefully backed by Republican Gov .\nHenry McMaster and GOP lawmakers who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not school officials .\nThe ruling was n't even a close call , U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis wrote , stopping the state from enforcing a one-year ban placed in the budget .\n“ It is noncontroversial that children need to go to school .\nAnd , they are entitled to any reasonable accommodation that allows them to do so .\nNo one can reasonably argue that it is an undue burden to wear a mask to accommodate a child with disabilities , ” Lewis wrote .\nLewis compared the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can no longer install wheelchair ramps .\n“ Masks must , at a minimum , be an option for school districts to employ to accommodate those with disabilities so they , too , can access a free public education , ” the judge wrote .\nMcMaster 's spokesman Brian Symmes said Tuesday 's ruling is n't the last word in the case .\n“ The governor strongly disagrees with the court ’ s decision and will defend a parent ’ s right to decide what ’ s best for their children up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary , ” Symmes said in a statement , The ruling was n't a surprise because the rights of medically fragile students were violated , said Susan Mizner , director of the ACLU ’ s Disability Rights Program .\n“ The court ’ s decision today makes clear that state legislators and Gov .\nMcMaster can ’ t sacrifice the health and safety of students with disabilities for the convenience of others , '' Mizner said in a statement .\nThe Republican-dominated South Carolina House put the provision into the budget in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of about 150 new COVID-19 cases a day .\nNot long after the delta variant caused a spike in cases similar to last winter before vaccines were widely available .\nWell over 21,000 students have been infected with COVID-19 this school year and nearly 100,000 have had to quarantine because of close exposure , according to state health data .\nThe budget provision did n't outright ban districts from requiring masks , but said state money could n't be used to enforce a mask requirement .\nState money is tied into most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told school boards they could require masks and hire employees to enforce the requirement with federal COVID-19 relief money .\nSeveral districts have gone ahead and required masks .\nOther school boards have asked lawmakers to come back into session and change the rules , which they so far have refused to do .\nThey have been joined by groups of doctors , teachers and school administrators .\nAttempts to get the state Supreme Court to allow mask requirements in schools or overturn the provision have failed .\nLewis wrote in her ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not making a comment on whether the General Assembly 's provision was “ COVID incompetence .

         "Algerians’ Freedom of Speech Strained by Media Laws Passed Under COVID-19 Pretext. Algeria has been in turmoil since early 2019 .\nA popular anti-government street protest movement , called Hirak , gathered massive support across different ethnic and social segments of the society and is still ongoing .\nTo this , the government has responded with laws and measures that limit freedom of expression , and has often justified that by the need to fight the pandemic .\nThe Hirak movement started on February 2019 , a few days after president Abdelaziz Boutefikla , in power since 1999 , announced he would run for a fifth mandate .\nThe people of Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 .\nEventually , Boutefikla conceded defeat and resigned on April 2 , 2019 .\nYet , his resignation did not bring changes expected by a majority of Algerians .\nThey therefore continued to protest peacefully every single Friday across the country to press for significant political changes and an end to large-scale corruption .\nAs this Twitter account that monitors the Hirak movement explains , the issue at play is the mindset of the government which is perceived as using various arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip over society : The authorities did eventually respond to the movement by holding presidential elections in December 2020 , which were won by Abdelmajid Tebboune .\nYet , the vote was largely boycotted , reflecting little confidence

their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis ’ 83 in 2006 .\nPlus , some agonizing history in Atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 .\nThe Braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year .\nThe Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season .\nAnd then there was the big one , the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl .\nBut these Braves , not this time .\nFavored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title , the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July .\nEarlier , 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy .\nProjected ace Mike Soroka never got back from an Achilles injury .\nGoing into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork .\nThey had a guy who made his big league debut in October , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago .\nToss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew .\nMany continue to heckle them as the “ Cheatin ’ Astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever .\nCertainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker .\nA World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century .\nThe 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones , aces Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux and John Smoltz , and manager Bobby Cox .\nThose rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles .\nThe 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season .\nHis 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park , and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 Boston Braves , too , dubbed the “ Miracle Braves ” back in the day .\nIn last place on the Fourth of July , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A ’ s — to earn their nickname .\nThe Braves ’ previous title came at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , their first home after moving from Milwaukee to the Deep South in 1966 .\nThen there was Turner Field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled Minute Maid Park .\nQuite a change from last October .\nOnly a limited capacity was permitted for that World Series as the Dodgers beat Tampa Bay at a neutral-site stadium in Arlington , Texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus .\nNow , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months .\nA squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport .\nIn the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal .\nAstros : Scheduled to start the spring training schedule on Feb. 26 vs. St. Louis .",

Bush 's daily intelligence briefer and was traveling with the president on the day the planes hit the towers , will also share personal reflections and new details about the CIA 's race to provide answers and protect the country from further terror attacks .\nThe series will launch the week of August 9 and run for five weeks , with its first episode premiering on August 11 , 2021 and its final episode running on September 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attacks : `` I 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , or for us as individuals .

We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide

to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to

seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed

bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Several congressional Republicans are expressing their public opposition to President Joe Biden ’ s nominee to head the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) over her past ties to ecoterrorist activity .\nSen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) , who is ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , the committee that will vote on Tracy Stone-Manning ’ s nomination ahead of a full Senate vote , said he plans to object to the nomination .\n“ Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists who had booby trapped trees with metal spikes .\n… She did not cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Barrasso said in a statement .\nSen. Jim Risch ( R-ID ) , another Energy Committee member , said she is “ unfit ” to lead the BLM and called on Biden to withdraw the nomination .\nIn 1993 , Stone-Manning testified against two individuals in her “ circle of friends , ” one being John P.

you ’ ve got to keep on trucking , and that gives you even more incentive next year , ” baker said . “ it ’ s tough to take now , but this too shall pass . i mean , it really hurts , but it ’ s over , ” he added . major credit for the braves , too , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acuña ’ s knee injury , he pulled off a flurry of july trades that brought the fab four to the outfield — nl championship series mvp eddie rosario , adam duvall , joc pederson and soler . but even in the analytics era , guided by a gm fully versed in new-age ways , the path these braves took wouldn ’ t add up in any computer . especially with how things looked in midseason . “ at that time , we were searching , ” third baseman austin riley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ’ s no question about that. ” minus acuña , atlanta wasn ’ t over .500 for a single day until the first week in august . the braves finished 88-73 for the 12th-best record in the majors and fewest victories among playoff teams ; their win total was the lowest for a world series champion since st. louis ’ 83 in 2006 . plus , some agonizing history in atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 . the braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the dodgers in the nlcs last year . the hawks fell short in the eastern conference finals last season . and then there was the big one , the falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the patriots in the super bowl . but these braves , not this time . favored in spring training to win their fourth straight nl east title , the braves lost acuña to a torn knee in july . earlier , 2020 triple crown contender marcell ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy . projected ace mike soroka never got back from an achilles injury . going into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork . they had a guy who made his big league debut in october , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the texas airhogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago . toss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against jose altuve and the houston crew . many continue to heckle them as the “ cheatin ’ astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever . certainly a lot of people were cheering for baker . a world series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century . the 1995 atlanta champs featured five future hall of famers — rookie chipper jones , aces tom glavine , greg maddux and john smoltz , and manager bobby cox . those rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles . the 1957 milwaukee braves were led by aaron in his only nl mvp season . his 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at truist park , and baker and snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 boston braves , too , dubbed the “ miracle braves ” back in the day . in last place on the fourth of july , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the philadelphia a ’ s — to earn their nickname . the braves ’ previous title came at atlanta-fulton county stadium , their first home after moving from milwaukee to the deep south in 1966 . then there was turner field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled minute maid park . quite a change from last october . only a limited capacity was permitted for that world series as the dodgers beat tampa bay at a neutral-site stadium in arlington , texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus . now , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months . a squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . in the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal . astros : scheduled to start the spring training schedule on feb. 26 vs. st. louis .",

We tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort ; it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to some nation state issues .\nThat changed after 9/11 .\nIt was a big effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 9/11 , that changed .\nKabul falling to Taliban : `` I 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\nIt 's a tragedy . ''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

'' download , rate and subscribe here : itunes , spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to intelligence matters . it is very good to have you on the show . and much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again . winston wiley : good to talk to you . michael morell : so , winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , i wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career . and one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that i would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me . and i do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to hawaii . and i had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday . i really took that to heart . and for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pdb staff , briefing the president , serving overseas . and i just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and i think should be important to them . winston wiley : oh , well , thank you for remembering that . i do n't remember in as much details as you just made . it 's consistent with what i believe and what i tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place . i saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better . so my time in ctc and then coming back to be addi and adci for homeland security was kind of true to that . and i and i tried to share that with as many people as possible . and i 'm glad you found it useful . michael morell : i listened . i actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory . before we talk about 9/11 , i 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 . we 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later . but but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ? winston wiley : ok. well , you know , how did i wind up with the agency is pretty easy . i was born into it . my dad was not in o.s.s . but was a charter member of cia when it was formed in '47 . and the time i was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , i went to american university and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family . i then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that i 'd have a career in operations . but i found my interim assignments and the directorate of intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old office of current intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the near east and south asian analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late bob ames and helene boatner . worked for them until 1985 or so . then i went to the office of global issues as a deputy to david carey , who later became executive director of the agency . i worked for dave four or five times . and got my first division assignment running the international issues division in ogi . and i did that for five years . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ig staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for bob layton and the office of near east south asian analysis , as head of the persian gulf division . and that 's where i was when on the day saddam invaded kuwait in 1991 . worked through 1992 on running persian gulf division and found time to look for another job after five years at nesa and was asked to become the deputy in the in the counterterrorism center . the center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst . and i got to work with steve ahr as his deputy for two years . steve moved up to be the chief of the ne division and i took over as chief of ctc . and brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order . and i spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where i found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence . michael morell : so , winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence . you were in charge of all the analysts . you were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 . can you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ? winston wiley : well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out . we write the first draft and put to bed the president 's daily brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those . in the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the di . and my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible . michael morell ? winston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in ctc and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ? how were you thinking about that ? winston wiley : well , we 'd been worried about al-qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew . while i was still in ctc , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort . really with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al qaeda as a group . we tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one . after 9/11 , that changed . michael morell : ok , winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ? i know you did not plan to come to work that day . can you walk us through it for us ? winston wiley : well . indeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at bwi airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to california @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the united states as the attacks were going on . i 'll never forget the phone call i got as i was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the world trade center . i sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morell : so i suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?

winston wiley : surprisingly , very , very little . when i went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate . at that point . i was directed towards the security guy who told me i needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - i went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand . an unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to bwi michael morell : and did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ? winston wiley : i got to the gate . and i had told them , you know , 'you guys are n't flying today . ' the word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled . i was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you took them home . and did you come to work then ? winston wiley : well , i took them home . but you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home . and that was just a solid jam . i turned around and went to the baltimore washington parkway and took that down . it took a lifetime of living in the washington area , knowing back roads to get to places . all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower pennsylvania , delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the pentagon fire . and i guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where i rejoined my deputies and george and others . i was in touch by phone . the team knew very well what to do , if nothing else . i mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus . and the team fell back on that . and , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support . i think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period . leave it to him to decide . michael morell : so , winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?

winston wiley : yeah . when you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground.. many , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work . and i think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small . but that is a labor intensive task . michael morell : so sometime after 9/11 , george tenet , the director of central intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position . can you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in june of the following year , the director asked if i would stand up a position , called the associate director for homeland security . by then the white house had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level department of homeland security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue . as adci , he asked not that i assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homeland security , but that i use the background and knowledge that i had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort . i added one deputy from the ops directorate at cia , another deputy from nsa , one from dia and one from nsa , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities . at the time , the dci had both cia and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point . and so with the creation of ctc those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side . and , you know , i think even if you worked in that environment for a while . michael morell : so , winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u.s. government brought osama bin laden to justice on may 1st , 2011 . what was your reaction ? what was your reaction when you heard that ? winston wiley : elation . just , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever i was watching , there was really only one thing i could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , i watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated . michael morell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , i want you to compare it to the bringing of mir aimal kanzi to justice . i think you were at dulles airport , along with director tenet when the fbi returned him to the united states from pakistan . and maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there . winston wiley : well , mir aimal kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three . that began - at the time i was the relatively new deputy director in ctc and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work . and i was in ctc for five years after that . and every night before i left , i got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for mir aimal kanzi . without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the fbi was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the united states to be turned over to virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here . i was asked along with many others , if i wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , i would not have missed it . i wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers . i saw him march by on the arms of brad garrett , the lead fbi officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers . but brad marched them from the air force plane that brought him into dulles airport , because it was in virginia and in the same fairfax county district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ? it was n't elation at all . it was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when i saw , 'wow , what a weaselly little character he was . ' micahel morell : winston , i would n't be doing my job if i did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course . we 're taping this the day after kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the taliban won . and i 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday . winston wiley : michael , it 's too soon . i 've been you know , i 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment . it will change us . i hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : i 'm winston , maybe just one more question , and i was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about bob ames . yes . and you talked about working for him when he was running the near east south asia office . and i would bet most of my listeners do n't know about bob . and i was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened . since we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the middle east , there is a book that was written by kai bird about him , 'the perfect spy ' by kai bird . to all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read . bob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people i 've met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle east . and director casey asked him to take over nesa and one of the very few people that i recall , having served as both the director of a di office and in a senior position . and as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building . his loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man . i think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency . and we lost him far too young an age . michael morell : winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",
