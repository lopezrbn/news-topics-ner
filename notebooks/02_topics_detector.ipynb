         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to protect “ liberties ” and “ freedoms ” , the truth is that those that reject the culture that is being pushed on them by the global elite will be increasingly marginalized on the fringes of society .\nAmerica ’ s founders were very suspicious of all large concentrations of power .\nToday , wealth and power are more concentrated in our society than ever before , and that is not a good thing .\nIn fact , this is an existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not that many people are focusing on this .\nAnd don ’ t expect our politicians in Washington to do anything .\nThey want to keep the campaign donations flowing , and so very few of them are ever interested in confronting the big money interests on Wall Street .\n***Michael ’ s new book entitled “ Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America ” is now

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis ’ 83 in 2006 .\nPlus , some agonizing history in Atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 .\nThe Braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year .\nThe Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season .\nAnd then there was the big one , the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl .\nBut these Braves , not this time .\nFavored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title , the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July .\nEarlier , 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy .\nProjected ace Mike Soroka never got back from an Achilles injury .\nGoing into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork .\nThey had a guy who made his big league debut in October , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago .\nToss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew .\nMany continue to heckle them as the “ Cheatin ’ Astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever .\nCertainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker .\nA World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century .\nThe 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones , aces Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux and John Smoltz , and manager Bobby Cox .\nThose rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles .\nThe 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season .\nHis 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park , and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 Boston Braves , too , dubbed the “ Miracle Braves ” back in the day .\nIn last place on the Fourth of July , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A ’ s — to earn their nickname .\nThe Braves ’ previous title came at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , their first home after moving from Milwaukee to the Deep South in 1966 .\nThen there was Turner Field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled Minute Maid Park .\nQuite a change from last October .\nOnly a limited capacity was permitted for that World Series as the Dodgers beat Tampa Bay at a neutral-site stadium in Arlington , Texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus .\nNow , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months .\nA squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport .\nIn the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal .\nAstros : Scheduled to start the spring training schedule on Feb. 26 vs. St. Louis .",

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as

seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you

creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Demolition of a large cargo ship along the coast of Georgia is entering its fifth month , with work to chop the ship into eight large pieces going far slower than the salvage crew anticipated SAVANNAH , Ga. -- When salvage crews began cutting apart the capsized Golden Ray , a shipwreck the size of a 70-story office building with 4,200 cars within its cargo decks , in early November they predicted the demolition could be wrapped up by New Year 's Day .\nFour months later , the job remains far from finished .\nBoth ends of the cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by barges in a pair of giant chunks .\nBut roughly three-fourths of the vessel remains beached on its side off St. Simons Island on the Georgia coast , where the South Korean freighter overturned soon after leaving port Sept. 8 , 2019 .\n“ It ’ s been nothing but problems out here , ” said Andy Jones , a St. Simons Island resident who heads to the wreck site in his small fishing boat most days to monitor the demolition and post updates to a YouTube channel .\n“ It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvage experts decided more than a year ago that the Golden Ray , measuring 656 feet ( 199 meters ) long , was too big to remove intact .\nThey settled on a plan to carve the ship into eight massive chunks , each weighing up to 4,100 tons ( 3,720 metric tonnes ) .\nThey straddled the wreck with a towering crane with a winch and

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

London received a vote of confidence from Berkeley Group this morning as the housebuilder ’ s boss said he believed the capital is set for a post-pandemic boom .\nThe Group made a profit before tax of more than half a billion pounds in its last financial year , much of which was driven by the sale of properties worth more than £700,000 , it confirmed to markets this morning .\nThe housebuilder saw profit before tax of £518.1m , up slightly from £503.7m in its last financial year .\nRevenue at the business stood at £2.2bn for the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley said it sold 2,825 homes in London and the South East at an average selling price of £770,000 , which helped to drive revenue for the year .\nChief executive Rob Perrins said : “ Today ’ s strong results reflect the consistent and focused application of Berkeley ’ s uniquely long-term business model , the quality of the homes and places we create and our proficiency in adapting to the challenges of the pandemic , sustaining production throughout.\n” The housebuilder added 10 new brownfield sites to its land holdings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,650 new homes for the future , and advanced a further 7,000 homes in its immediate pipeline .\nDespite the housing boom , the value of Berkeley ’ s private sales was 20 per cent lower than in the previous financial year .\nThe business , which last year built 10 per cent of new homes in London , said the capital would thrive again when Covid restrictions had been lifted .\n“ This is a very strong platform from which to continue serving the most under supplied housing markets in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipates and London is again able to flourish as a global destination for culture , entertainment , education , recreation and business , ” Perrins continued .\n“ London is one of the world ’ s greatest open and welcoming cities and it has been wonderful to witness its vibrancy returning over recent weeks , with the gradual lifting of restrictions .\nPeople thrive on its energy , opportunity and unparalleled attributes.\n” Berkeley Group ’ s share price fell 2.28 per cent shortly after the market open , as investors reacted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .\nAnthony Codling , CEO of property platform Twindig , said : “ In a period covering lockdowns one , two and three , Berkeley Group has grown revenue , grown profits and increased the number of homes it sold .\n“ We may have embraced working from home , but it appears that not all are leaving London and the South East in search of a rural idyll .\n“ Looking ahead , Berkeley has a very strong balance sheet , a strong order book and more than £1bn of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in Euro ’ s it would be Berkeley 1 Pandemic nil.\n” Richard Hunter , head of markets at Interactive Investor , added : “ Berkeley ’ s heavy exposure to London has been both a blessing and a curse , although the company remains convinced of recovery in the capital .\n“ The effects of the pandemic on the London market put pressure on its traditional home buyers , where there is a broadly even split of owner-occupiers and ( overseas ) investors .\nWith international travel restrictions muddying the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this core market for the group has been under pressure .\n“ Despite these developments , the London market remains one where there is strong undersupply , and Berkeley remains committed to its presence .\n“ There is a clear debate on the lasting effects of the pandemic on city life , as some buyers have chosen to move to more rural areas and as the requirements for commuting have significantly reduced .\nBy the same token , London has its own idiosyncratic attractions which the group believes remain intact .\n“ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than those seen in pre-pandemic times .\n”",

Rolls Royce was already in serious difficulty even before the pandemic wind came blowing in from China a year ago , due to problems with its Trent 1000 engine that powered the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .\nToday ’ s full year results were not any better , and did not come as a surprise for CMC Markets UK chief market analyst Michael Hewson , given the virtual grounding of civil air travel which almost delivered a final coup de grace to the business last year .\n“ At one point there was some concern as to whether this iconic British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake of the collapse in air miles as a result of the pandemic , ” Hewson said .\nRead more : Rolls-Royce plunges to huge loss as Covid turbulence sets in Still in the red This morning ’ s operating loss of £2.1bn is almost identical to 2018 ’ s results .\n“ While the size of the loss is certainly sobering , unlike last year optimism is probably in shorter supply due to the uncertainty about when air travel is likely to return to any kind of normal post pandemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating loss wasn ’ t bad enough , when other costs are added the loss balloons to an even bigger £4bn , due to the addition of other charges , Hewson pointed out , including a £1.7bn underlying finance charge related to its FX hedge book , due to lower US dollar receipts in 2020 , as well as future years .\n“ Coming into the pandemic , the company was very reliant for up to 50 per cent of its revenue on these aviation air miles , which means the company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash outflow , even with the thousands of job cuts and cost savings , ” he noted .\nManagement has gone to great lengths to deal with this cash flow problem in order to get the business through to the other side of the pandemic .\nThe launch of a £1bn bond issue as well as a £2bn 10 for 3 rights issue at a 41 per cent discount to 130p was eventually taken up by shareholders , and along with the progress on the vaccine rollout the company has seen a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 17-year lows we saw in September last year .\nRead more : Rolls-Royce picks former Deloitte partner Kakoullis as finance chief Not out of the woods yet The company still is not out of the woods yet , announcing that it is likely going to have shut its factories in the summer for two weeks to help stem the losses .\n“ This morning ’ s full year results only serve to reinforce the scale of the challenge facing the civil aerospace side of the business , however at least in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a little bit better than was expected , ” Hewson said .\n“ With revenues coming in at £11.76bn , [ this is ] still well below the £15.45bn we saw in 2019 , but certainly much better than had originally been feared all the way back in the late summer of last year.\n” Free cash outflow for the last tax year came in at an eye watering high £4.18bn .\nAt its last trading update , the company estimated a free cash flow outflow of £2bn for 2021 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of 55 per cent of the levels of 2019 , with an expectation of turning cash flow positive at the end of the second half of this fiscal year , with positive free cash flow of £750m in 2022 , based on engine flying hours of 80 per cent of 2019 levels , Hewson noted .\n“ This expectation hasn ’ t changed , even though it comes across as very optimistic , given that since they made that assessment air travel has remained very much in the doldrums due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place since the beginning of January , ” he added .\nAt the time this seemed a touch optimistic , Hewson continued , given that air travel is unlikely to be able to return to any semblance of normal this year , given that the government is embarking on a very slow reopening policy .\n“ This morning ’ s numbers are a sobering reminder of how much damage the pandemic has done to an iconic brand , and also illustrate how hard the long road back will be , ” he remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to take years to return to normal it will be more important than ever that Rolls Royce steps up in other areas of its business to offset the revenue hit to civil aviation over the next few years , and get greater returns there .\n“ The hope is that investors and shareholders retain the patience seen so far in terms of the rally in the share price off last year ’ s multiyear lows , ” Hewson concluded .",

         "Yuval Noah Harari on the future of the human race. When Yuval Noah Harari published his first book , `` Sapiens , '' in 2014 about the history of the human species , it became a global bestseller , and turned the little-known , Israeli history professor into one of the most popular writers and thinkers on the planet .\nBut when we met with Harari in Tel Aviv this summer , it was n't our species ' past that concerned him , it was our future .\nHarari believes we may be on the brink of creating not just a new , enhanced species of human , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is far more intelligent than we are .\nIt sounds like science fiction , but Yuval Noah Harari says it 's actually much more dangerous than that .\nAnderson Cooper : You said , `` We are one of the last generations of Homo sapiens .\nWithin a century or two , Earth will be dominated by entities that are more different from us than we are different from chimpanzees . ''\nAnderson Cooper : What the hell does that mean ?\nThat freaked me out .\nYuval Noah Harari : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-engineer our bodies and brains , whether it is with genetic engineering or by directly connecting brains to computers , or by creating completely non-organic entities , artificial intelligence which is not based at all on the organic body and the organic brain .\nAnd these technologies are developing at break-neck speed .\nAnderson Cooper : If that is true , then it creates a whole other species .\nYuval Noah Harari : This is something which is way beyond just another species .\nYuval Noah Harari is talking about the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other technologies like gene editing - that could one day enable parents to create smarter or more attractive children , and brain computer interfaces that could result in human/machine hybrids .\nAnderson Cooper : What does that do to a society ?\nIt seems like the rich will have access whereas others would n't .\nYuval Noah Harari : One of the dangers is that we will see in the coming decades a process of -- of s -- of -- greater inequality than in any previous time in history because for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real biological inequality .\nIf the new technologies are available only to the rich or only to people from a certain country then Homo sapiens will split into different biological castes because they really have different bodies and -- and different abilities .\nHarari has spent the last few years lecturing and writing about what may lie ahead for humankind .\nHarari at Davos in 2018 : In the coming generations we will learn how to engineer bodies and brains and minds .\nHe has written two books about the challenges we face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' and `` 21 Lessons for the 21st Century '' -- which along with `` Sapiens '' have sold more than 35 million copies and been translated into 65 languages .\nHis writings have been recommended by President Barack Obama , as well as tech moguls , Bill Gates , and Mark Zuckerberg .\nAnderson Cooper : You raise warnings about technology .\nYou 're also embraced by a lot of folks in Silicon Valley .\nYuval Noah Harari : They are a bit afraid of their own power .\nThat they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , over the course of evolution , really .\nAnd I think that spooks at least some of them .\nAnd that 's a good thing .\nAnd this is why they are kind of to some extent open to listening .\nAnderson Cooper : You started as a history professor .\nWhat do you call yourself now ?\nYuval Noah Harari : I 'm still a historian .\nBut I think history is the study of change , not just the study of the past .\nBut it covers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ph.D. in history at Oxford , and lives in Israel , where the past is still very present .\nHe took us to an archeological site called Tel Gezer .\nHarari says cities like this were only possible because about 70,000 years ago our species - Homo sapiens - experienced a cognitive change that helped us create language , which then made it possible for us to cooperate in large groups and drive Neanderthals and all other less cooperative human species into extinction .\nHarari fears we are now the ones at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYuval Noah Harari : Maybe the biggest thing that we are facing is really a kind of evolutionary divergence .\nFor millions of years , intelligence and consciousness went together .\nConsciousness is the ability to feel things , like pain and pleasure and love and hate .\nIntelligence is the ability to solve problems .\nBut computers or artificial intelligence , they do n't have consciousness .\nThey just have intelligence .\nThey solve problems in a completely different way than us .\nNow in science fiction , it 's often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more intelligent , they will inevitably also gain consciousness .\nBut actually , it 's -- it 's much more frightening than that in a way they will be able to solve more and more problems better than us without having any consciousness , any feelings .\nAnderson Cooper : And they will have power over us ?\nYuval Noah Harari : They are already gaining power over us .\nSome lenders routinely use complex artificial intelligence algorithms to determine who qualifies for loans and global financial markets are moved by decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data in ways even their programmers do n't always understand .\nHarari says the countries and companies that control the most data will in the future be the ones that control the world .\nYuval Noah Harari : Today in the world , data is worth much more than money .\nTen years ago , you had these big corporations paying billions and billions for WhatsApp , for Instagram .\nAnd people wondered , `` Are they crazy ?\nWhy do they pay billions to get this application that does n't produce any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nBecause it produced data .\nAnderson Cooper : And data is the key ?\nYuval Noah Harari : The world is increasingly kind of cut up into spheres of -- of data collection , of data harvesting .\nIn the Cold War , you had the Iron Curtain .\nNow we have the Silicon Curtain between the USA and China .\nAnd where does the data go ?\nCalifornia or does it go to Shenzhen and to Shanghai and to Beijing ?\nHarari is concerned the pandemic has opened the door for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including biometric data .\nYuval Noah Harari : It 's data about what 's happening inside my body .\nWhat we have seen so far .\nIt 's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go , who we meet , what movies we watch .\nThe next phase is surveillance going under our skin .\nAnderson Cooper : I 'm wearing a , like a tracker that tracks my heart rate , my sleep .\nI do n't know where that information is going .\nYuval Noah Harari : You wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnderson Cooper : And I think it 's benefiting me .\nYuval Noah Harari : And it is benefiting you .\nI mean , the whole thing is that it 's not just dystopian .\nIt 's also utopian .\nI mean , this kind of data can also enable us to create the best health care system in history .\nThe question is what else is being done with that data ?\nAnd who supervises it ?\nWho regulates it ?\nEarlier this year , the Israeli government gave its citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority access to their vaccine .\nThe data did not include individual citizens ' identities .\nAnderson Cooper : So what does Pfizer want the data of all Israelis for ?\nYuval Noah Harari : Because to develop new medicines , new treatments you need the medical data .\nIncreasingly , that 's the basis for how -- for medical research .\nIt 's not all bad .\nHarari has been criticized for pointing out problems without offering solutions , but he does have some ideas about how to limit the misuse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key rule is that if you get my data , the data should be used to help me and not to manipulate me .\nAnother key rule , that whenever you increase surveillance of individuals you should simultaneously increase surveillance of the corporation and governments and the people at the top .\nAnd the third principle is that , never allow all the data to be concentrated in one place .\nThat 's the recipe for a dictatorship .\nHarari speaking at The Future of Education : Netflix tells us what to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEventually within 10 or 20 or 30 years such algorithms could also tell you what to study at college and where to work and whom to marry and even whom to vote for .\nWithout greater regulation , Harari believes we are at risk of becoming what he calls `` hacked humans . ''\nAnderson Cooper : What does that mean ?\nYuval Noah Harari : To hack a human being is to get to know that person better than they know themselves .\nAnd based on that , to increasingly manipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential to remember everything .\nEverything you ever did .\nAnd to analyze and find patterns in this data and to get a much better idea of who you really are .\nI came out as gay when I was 21 .\nIt should 've been obvious to me when I was 15 that I 'm gay .\nBut something in the mind blocked it .\nNow , if you think about a teenager today , Facebook can know that they are gay or Amazon can know that they are gay long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns .\nAnderson Cooper : And based on that , you can tell somebody 's sexual orientation ?\nYuval Noah Harari : Completely .\nAnd what does it mean if you live in Iran or if you live in Russia or in some other homophobic country and the police know that you are gay even before you know it ?\nAnderson Cooper : When people think about data they think about companies finding out what their likes and dislikes are but the data that you 're talking about goes much deeper than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think in 20 years when the entire personal history of every journalist , every judge , every politician , every military officer is held by somebody in Beijing or in Washington ?\nYour ability to manipulate them is like nothing before in history .\nHarari lives outside Tel Aviv with his husband , Itzik Yahav .\nThey have been together for nearly 20 years .\nIt was Yahav who read Harari 's lecture notes for a history course and convinced him to turn them into his first book – `` Sapiens . ''\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI could n't stop talking about it .\nFor me , it was clear that it could be a huge bestseller .\nYahav is now Harari 's agent , and together they started a company called Sapienship .\nThey are creating an interactive exhibit that will take visitors through the history of human evolution and challenge them to think about the future of mankind .\nHarari also just published the second installment of a graphic novel based on `` Sapiens . ''\nAnd he 's teaching courses at Israel 's Hebrew University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bioengineers .\nHarari teaching : When people write code , they are reshaping politics and economics and ethics , and the structure of human society .\nAnderson Cooper : When I think of coders and engineers , I do n't think of philosophers and poets .\nYuval Noah Harari : It 's not the case now , but it should be the case because they are increasingly solving philosophical and poetical riddles .\nIf you 're designing , you know , a self-driving car , so the self-driving car will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid jumps in front of the car .\nAnd the only way to -- to -- to prevent running over the kid is to swerve to the side and be hit by a truck .\nAnd your own-owner who is asleep in the backseat will -- might be killed .\nYou need to tell the algorithm what to do in this situation .\nSo you need to actually solve the philosophical question , who to kill .\nLast month the United Nations suggested a moratorium on artificial intelligence systems that seriously threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and advisers to President Biden are proposing what they call a `` bill of rights '' to guard against some of the new technologies .\nHarari says just as Homo sapiens learned to cooperate with each other many thousands of years ago , we need to cooperate now .\nYuval Noah Harari : Certainly .\nNow , we are at the point when we need global cooperation .\nYou can not regulate the explosive power of artificial intelligence on a national level .\nI 'm not trying to kind of prophesy what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn people about the most dangerous possibilities , in the hope that we will do something in the present to prevent them .",

         "Should the minimum wage really be $26 an hour?. The federal minimum wage in the U.S. has remained glued at $ 7.25 an hour for the last 12 years , the longest stretch without a boost since it was first adopted in 1938 .\nYet there 's another revealing figure that underscores how the minimum wage — created by Congress after the Great Depression as a way to ensure that Americans were fairly paid for their labor — has failed to keep up with the times .\nEven as workers have been more industrious — helping drive corporate profits , the stock market and CEO compensation to record heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even declined when factoring in inflation .\nIf the minimum wage had kept pace with gains in the economy 's productivity over the last 50 years , it would be nearly $ 26 an hour today , or more than $ 50,000 a year in annual income , one economist notes .\n`` That may sound pretty crazy , but that 's roughly what the minimum wage would be today if it had kept pace with productivity growth since its value peaked in 1968 , '' wrote Dean Baker , senior economist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research , in a recent blog post .\nProductivity — how much income someone generates in an hour of work — is critical for the economy because it helps determine a country 's standard of living .\nYet rising productivity is no guarantee of a healthy economy .\nEqually important is how the fruits of productivity are divided .\nTo that end , `` Having the minimum wage track productivity growth is not a crazy idea , '' Baker said .\nA recent CBS News poll found that most Americans support a hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that cut across socioeconomic status .\nNationwide , nearly 250,000 workers earn $ 7.25 per hour , while roughly 865,000 earn less than that , labor data show .\nTo be sure , dozens of states and cities have boosted their baseline wages over the past few years , especially in areas with a high cost of living such as California , where the minimum wage is now $ 14 an hour for employers with at least 26 workers .\nYet the federal minimum wage remains in effect in 20 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker 's analysis comes at an uneasy time for millions of workers across the U.S. , even as they celebrate Labor Day .\nThe COVID-19 Delta variant means many white-collar workers wo n't return to the office until 2022 , while many lower wage workers continue to cope with the risk of getting infected , not to mention confrontations with anti-mask or anti-vaccine customers .\nInequality also widened during the pandemic , with the wealth of the richest Americans surging as stocks soared , while those at the bottom were more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also more likely to work in jobs where they faced a great chance of catching COVID-19 .\n`` Dean makes an important point .\nWhether or not you should argue it should be $ 26 , it is a very strong point illustrating what has been happening with our economy , '' said Ken Jacobs , the chair of the University of California , Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education .\nSince the 1970s , `` We have seen that complete divorce between wages and productivity and massively increased inequality with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ''\nA $ 26 an hour minimum wage might strike some as unrealistic , with Baker noting that his analysis is more of a `` thought experiment '' than a practical proposition .\nFor one , more than tripling the federal baseline wage would result in a host of undesirable economic effects , from a spike in unemployment ( as employers would need to cut jobs in order to pay the workers they could afford to keep on ) to higher inflation .\n`` The problem is that we have made many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of income upward , so that we can not support a pay structure that gives workers at the bottom $ 52,000 a year , '' Baker wrote .\nSo what happened in the 1970s that decoupled the minimum wage from productivity gains ?\nThe weakening of unions over the past several decades is believed to be one cause , eroding the ability of workers to collectively bargain and win wage gains and other concessions .\nOrganized labor is now at its lowest membership levels in the modern era , with only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union in 2019 , down from 2 in 10 in 1983 .\nAt the same time , wage gains have increasingly gone to college-educated workers , a trend that accelerated after the Great Recession , as employers outsourced or automated jobs , reducing their need for modestly paid workers .\nThe current administration is aiming to shore up unions , with President Joe Biden vowing to be `` the strongest labor president you have ever had . ''\nDemocratic lawmakers have supported the Protecting the Right to Organize ( PRO ) Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize and bargain collectively .\nLabor Day was created by the labor movement more than a century ago to celebrate the American worker .\nBut the past year has n't been a happy one for many of the nation 's 161 million workers .\nFor one , 9.1 million workers are losing pandemic unemployment benefits on the holiday as the aid expires .\nThere 's not much recourse for those who are still struggling with unemployment , with the Biden administration saying it wo n't extend the federal jobless programs .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading across the nation , there are signs of economic headwinds , notably a sharp slowdown in hiring .\nThat effectively creates a Catch-22 , according to Daniel Kuehn , a research associate at the Urban Institute .\nAlthough businesses and institutions like schools must reopen — and stay open — for the labor market to continue healing from the impact of COVID-19 , the Delta variant 's rapid spread argues in favor of shutting down to safeguard public health .\nAlready , more than 3 million workers say they 're sitting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching or spreading the virus .\nThe loss of pandemic jobless benefits `` is going to be a disaster , and it 's an ironic disaster to happen on Labor Day , '' Kuehn said .\n`` What gets people back to work is businesses and society opening back up and having income to spend . ''\nMeanwhile , the workforce is still below its pre-pandemic size , with the labor force reaching a historic peak of more than 164 million workers in February 2020 , just before the crisis shut down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many others remain unemployed , and some parents with children continue to sit out of the labor market due to remote school and health concerns .\nThat 's led to a hiring crunch for some employers , especially for restaurants , bars , retailers and other mostly low-wage businesses that involve dealing with the public .\nSome employers have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits for keeping workers on the sidelines , but economists do n't see any evidence yet to support that .\nIn states that cut off those benefits in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth than in states that maintained the aid .\nThe difficulty in finding workers has helped lift wages for low-paid employees , although higher wages might not be enough to convince some people to come off the sidelines , Jacobs said .\n`` The fact that we saw some wage increases at the bottom and the middle in recent months is a positive sign for workers , but it does n't represent a long-run shift in the power balance in the workplace . ''\n`` We do n't have a labor shortage — @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' he added .\n`` Too many [ employers ] are offering too little to make it viable for them to take those jobs . ''",

         "Mother continues daughter’s art after losing her to Beirut blast. A young woman ’ s artistic dreams cut short by the 2020 Lebanon explosion is being carried further by her mother .\nBeirut , Lebanon – In early 2020 , Lebanese-Armenian designer Gaia Fodoulian was busy planning the launch of her new virtual gallery .\nThe 29-year-old sought to support the region ’ s artists and designers with a further-reaching , modern platform .\nOn August 4 , 2020 , her dreams were cut short by the massive explosion that rocked Beirut , devastating entire neighbourhoods , and destroying countless lives .\nFodoulian was one of the 208 people killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after she passed away , her mother , Annie Vartivarian , decided to complete her daughter ’ s work in her memory .\nEarlier this month , the virtual platform Art Design Lebanon ( AD Leb ) launched “ Everyone is the creator of one ’ s own faith ” , a physical pop-up exhibition at the blast-damaged historic Tabbal Building .\n“ Gaia had started this project and I wanted her name , her legacy to live on , even if she is no longer with us , ” Vartivarian told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she would have wanted me to do and I believe in what she was doing .\n“ I always trusted her instincts and would ask her , ‘ What do you think about this ?\n’ I still ask her sometimes , but of course , she doesn ’ t answer now , ” she added .\n“ A platform like AD Leb is needed in Lebanon and the region .\nI have faith in this venture that she had embarked on and wanted it to be realised.\n” All profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gaia Fodoulian Foundation , an organisation founded to support and care for animals in need and provides assistance for animal rescuers – a cause that Fodoulian cared deeply about .\nFodoulian had set aside some funds to produce her own design pieces – a pair of modular benches that could be made from concrete or wood , which she designed as a graduate student at Milan ’ s Istituto Marangoni .\nVartivarian took the designs and had the benches produced for AD Leb ’ s inaugural exhibition .\nGaïa Fodoulian ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one before she died in the blast [ Maghie Ghali/Al Jazeera ] The exhibition ’ s title comes from the photo caption of Fodoulian ’ s last social media post – a carefree snap of her running towards the camera on a trip to Sri Lanka .\nVartivarian said she made the post in a brief 15-minute lull in their busy afternoon , just a few hours before the blast .\n“ Even though she had a strong personality she was also very sensitive , which is what made her look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s why she posted that post at the last minute , that she knew her soul was leaving the world behind , ” Vartivarian said .\n“ I was so intrigued to know what was in her mind when she made that post .\nI thought about that caption a lot … So I proposed it to the artists in the show , kind of like Gaia ’ s last instruction to me maybe .\n“ I can ’ t say for sure what she had envisioned but if I start doubting everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added .\n“ She always used to ask me for my opinion on her designs and work , so I ’ m treating it like that now.\n” The pop-up show brings together both newly commissioned and existing works by artists and designers Samer Bou Rjeily , Karen Chekerdjian , Hatem Imam , Sirine Fattouh , Paul Kaloustian , Nathalie Khayat , Hussein Nassereddine and Caroline Tabet .\nKhayat ’ s work “ Light Sleepers ” is directly linked to last year ’ s tragedy , with an installation of 208 porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the blast .\nEach Raku-fired piece is unique , created with abstract shapes and moulded on impulse , glazed in a variety of colours .\n“ I made them in a very short period of time , so it was very intense work .\nI like that they have their own individuality and each carry their own story , ” Khayat told Al Jazeera .\n“ I like to work with the idea of rituals .\nFor me , lighting a candle is a ritual by itself .\nIt ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different occasions , it carries a different meaning behind it .\nIn this context , it ’ s a tribute for the people who lost their lives on August 4.\n” Other projects take a broader approach to the theme of faith and belief , such as Nassereddine ’ s sculptural installation “ The Red Castle , As It Occurred ” , inspired by a poem by the famous Abbasid poet Abu al-Mutanabbi .\nHe presents a tall limestone column , the material probably used to build the castle originally , tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era formula .\nThe piece draws attention to how something small led to an incorrect belief for centuries , simply because it was written down somewhere .\n“ He was describing a battle happening around this red castle , and for centuries it was believed so , because there are no remains of this castle now , all that remains is this poem , ” Nassereddine said .\n“ It was believed the castle was built from brick or red stone , but more archaeological research showed that there were no structures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red materials and it was only the poet ’ s imagination.\n” Each work is given its own room , spread across the first two floors of the spacious heritage building , with scenography designed by Ghaith & Jad .\nVartivarian wanted something with more history than the usual white-walled galleries or industrial warehouses often used .\nBuilt in the late 19th century and expanded during the French Mandate era , the building bears the characteristic lavishly decorated vaulted ceilings , triple arcade window , and geometric-tiled floors of many Lebanese heritages home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 800 heritage buildings that suffered damage during the blast , as most of Beirut ’ s Ottoman architecture lies close to the port .\n“ It just so happened that the owner of the building had passed away during the blast and also the building has been affected , ” she said .\n“ I felt something in this building , its character and that there was a connection between the building and the exhibition.\n” AD Leb hopes its use of the space will attract interest and result in proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has partnered with NGO Silat for Culture to organise free tours of the exhibition and the building ’ s history .\nAD Leb also has plans for a 3D video of the exhibition to reach outside audiences and an online programme of talks and on-site performances .\nIt hopes to schedule four exhibitions a year , featuring regional artists and collaborations with international practitioners and institutions .\nVartivarian aims for the platform to offer some hope to the Lebanese cultural community , which has taken a serious hit during the COVID-19 pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fallout from the blast .\nThe badly affected areas of Gemmayzeh and Mar Mikhael are home to most of the city ’ s galleries and cultural instructions .\nVartivarian ’ s own Letitia Gallery in Hamra shuttered for good following the blast .\n“ To accept the situation in Lebanon for what it is – hopeless at best – is to accept defeat , to fall into despair .\nIn order to carry on , day in and day out , I have to believe that eventually things will get better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hard to muster the energy , or even the courage , to emotionally invest … but it has been my duty to encourage everyone I worked with on this exhibition to fight this feeling and to not to give in to despair .\n”",

On Monday evening , Debra Haaland , a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblo of Laguna , became the first Native American ever to be confirmed as a Cabinet secretary .\nWhen she testified in February at her confirmation hearing , Haaland began her opening remarks by introducing herself to senators in her tribal language of Keresan .\n`` This historic nature of my confirmation is not lost on me , but I will say it 's not about me .\nRather , I hope this nomination would be an inspiration for Americans moving forward together as one nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Haaland said .\nShe grew up in a military family and later became a single mother who struggled to stay above the poverty line .\nHaaland eventually earned a bachelor 's degree in English from the University of New Mexico when she was 34 .\nTwelve years later she earned her J.D .\nin Indian law from University of New Mexico School of Law .\nBefore she was elected to Congress in 2018 , Haaland served as the tribal administrator for the San Felipe Pueblo for almost two years and then chaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same year , she and Kansas ' Sharice Davids became the first Native American women to serve in Congress .\nShe made history again when President Biden nominated her to lead the Interior Department .\n`` If an Indigenous woman from humble beginnings can be confirmed as secretary of the Interior , our country holds promise for everyone , '' Haaland said .\nThat feeling of promise is shared by other Indigenous people who spoke with CBS News about the significance of Haaland 's confirmation .\n`` I just think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to visibly see someone who looks like him , someone who comes from his same community , who is at that level , '' said Valerie Siow , an educator and Laguna Pueblo Native .\n`` Sometimes I ca n't even believe it . ''\n`` Never in my wildest dreams '' did Siow think she 'd one day witness a Cabinet secretary speaking her language .\nHer 9-year-old son attends a Native American charter school in Albuquerque , where he is learning the Laguna Keres dialect .\nThe introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siow is teaching her son , a practice meant to pay respect to one 's ancestors .\n`` That 's who you are , '' she told her son .\n`` You represent yourself to people in that way .

''\nAlong with the acreage itself come concerns about stewardship , about air , land and water quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pueblo once housed one of the world 's largest open uranium mines .\nIt employed much of the reservation 's population , moving Native Americans away from traditional farming and ranching jobs while stimulating the Pueblo economy .\nBut the mine exacted a terrible cost : it polluted reservation waters and lands , rendering areas unviable , and destroyed the health of those who worked there .\nHaaland 's background endows her with a certain `` empathy '' on the job , especially as it relates to conservation and combating the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land and we are part of the whole ecosystem in that we have a relationship and also responsibility to the ecosystem such that it sustains us , it gives us life .\nBut also if we violate those responsibilities , then there are consequences , '' he said .\nHaaland spoke to that philosophy during her confirmation hearing , recounting the first word Navajo Code Talkers transmitted to one another : Ne-he-mah , meaning `` our mother , '' the word they used to mean America .\n`` This is all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou 've heard the earth referred to [ as ] 'Mother Earth .

After a steady increase in pressure from outside groups and questions from the media , the Biden administration officially decided on Friday to break its pledge to lift President Donald Trump 's strict limits on refugee admissions for the fiscal year ending in September .\nDespite previously pledging to raise the cap on refugees from the extremely low level of 15,000 to 62,500 , Biden has reversed himself .\nDuring the presidential campaign , Biden pledged to raise the cap to 125,000 in the next fiscal year , and as recently as February , Secretary of State Tony Blinken had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this fiscal year would be increased more than fourfold .\nMany observers had become increasingly worried about Biden 's commitment to following through on this objective as the weeks dragged on without official action .\nSome reports indicated Biden was worried about the `` optics '' of raising the refugee cap .\nCNN 's Kaitlan Collins on April 8 pressed White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the issue given the delay , and Psaki insisted Biden was committed to the increase : But on Friday , the fears of refugee advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden is a cowardly betrayal of his many supporters who were horrified by Trump 's aggression toward and disregard for asylum seekers and refugees .\nPrior to the revelation of Biden 's reversal , The Atlantic writer Adam Serwer said on Twitter : `` Biden 's delay in reversing Trump 's discriminatory refugee restrictions is a violation of his campaign promises and the reasons he gave for running in the first place . ''\nIn a new piece , he wrote : So far , Biden has done a lot that is popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Rescue Plan , proposing a big infrastructure and spending package .\nAnd he may fear that increasing the refugee cap is unpopular and will derail the momentum that he has .\nIndeed , one Morning Consult poll found that increasing refugee admissions was the only major Biden priority that was unpopular .\nBut one reason for passing popular policies that meet people 's needs is to have more cover and trust with the public when taking values-based policy steps that might trigger some discontent .\nAnd it 's not as if raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — he campaigned on letting in more refugees , so he should n't feel the need to shy away from it now .\nIt is one of the easiest ways for a president to drastically improve a large number of human lives , saving families from dire conditions in refugee camps , with little or no downside .\nAnd there 's likely no upside at all to breaking this promise .\nThe anti-immigrant right wing will not give Biden any credit at all for backing down ; instead , it will likely just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further .\nThey 'll cite Biden 's capitulation on this promise as evidence that refugees really are a problem , and perhaps say that letting in any refugees is a problem .\nThis is a particularly terrible time for Biden to be retreating on the immigration issue , too , because anti-immigrant bigotry is resurgent .\nFox News 's Tucker Carlson , an influential leader in conservatism , is openly endorsing the white supremacist `` replacement theory , '' which Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson recently echoed .\nAnd on Friday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new , openly nativist caucus based on `` Anglo Saxon political traditions . ''\nMaybe this increasing sentiment on the right , combined with manufactured right-wing outrage about the border , has spooked Biden into capitulating on this issue .\nBut appeasing this bigotry wo n't work .\nIt will only embolden it .",

         "Columnist zeroes in on an under-the-radar Trump official working hard to 'sabotage' Biden. When President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20 , he will inherit a long list of problems — from a deadly pandemic to a painful recession to domestic terrorism by white nationalist groups .\nRegardless , many GOP partisans obviously have no desire to help Biden 's incoming administration , and journalist Dana Milbank cites Russell Vought as one of the worst partisans in a Washington Post column published on New Year 's Eve .\n`` If , in the new year , pandemic vaccines are n't available as promised , Americans ca n't return to work because economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully attacks the United States because national security agencies could n't pay for new defenses , a hefty share of the blame should be placed on a man you 've probably never heard of : one Russell Thurlow Vought , '' Milbank writes .\nVought has been serving as director of the Office and Management and Budget since July ; before that , he was OMB deputy director .\nAnd according to Milbank , one of Vought 's main goals is making things as difficult as possible for Biden 's administration — which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` What Russ Vought is very good at is sabotage , '' Milbank explains .\n`` He 's sabotaging national security , the pandemic response and the economic recovery — all to make things more difficult for the incoming Biden administration .\nThat he 's also sabotaging the country seems not to matter to Vought , who has spent nearly two decades as a right-wing bomb thrower . ''\nMilbank continues , `` He has blocked civil servants at OMB from cooperating with the Biden transition , denying President-elect Joe Biden the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents-elect , including Barack Obama and Trump himself .\nTransition figures warn that it will likely delay and hamper economic and pandemic relief and national security preparation . ''\nThe Post columnist notes that Vought has angrily accused Biden 's transition team of making `` false statements '' about the Trump OMB , denying that he has been uncooperative — only to confirm his lack of cooperation with this statement : `` What we have not done and will not do is use current OMB staff to write the ( Biden transition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration 's work… .\nRedirecting staff and resources to draft your team 's budget proposals is not an OMB transition responsibility .\nOur system of government has one president and one administration at a time . ''\nMilbank notes how much of an extremist Vought is .\nIn an anti-Islam article published on January 17 , 2016 , Vought wrote , `` Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology .\nThey do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ , his son , and they stand condemned . ''\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for RedState , Vought slammed an infrastructure bill as `` communism . ''\n`` Now , Vought is intentionally botching the transition , without regard for the dire consequences Americans could suffer , '' Milbank warns .\n`` This is what happens when you put an arsonist in charge of the fire department .

Prosecutors on Sunday said a teenager charged in the fatal shooting of a 7-year-old girl at a McDonald ’ s drive-thru was allegedly found with guns tied to the attack after he was shot during a police chase last week on the Eisenhower Expressway — but he was n't one of the gunmen .\nMarion Lewis , 18 , of East Garfield Park , faces counts of first-degree murder , attempted murder and a litany of other felony charges stemming from the killing of young Jaslyn Adams earlier this month and Thursday ’ s rush-hour pursuit .\nHe was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile Lewis wasn ’ t named as one of the alleged gunmen in Jaslyn ’ s shooting , Assistant State ’ s Attorney Kevin DeBoni linked him to the vehicle used in the her killing .\nDeBoni noted that Lewis was identified with the help of Jaslyn ’ s father , 28-year-old Jontae Adams , who was wounded in the April 18 shooting .\nThat afternoon , a silver Audi pulled into the parking lot of a McDonald ’ s , 3200 W. Roosevelt , and stopped behind Adams ’ tan Infiniti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when two individuals wearing hoods got out of the Audi and began firing into the car carrying Jaslyn , with one of them using a Draco , AK-47-style assault weapon with a “ banana clip , ” according to DeBoni .\nAfter both shooters hopped back into the Audi , Adams attempted to drive forward , prompting the suspects to get out of the car again and open fire .\nForty-five shell casings were recovered at the scene — 28 from the assault rifle and 17 more from a 40-caliber handgun , DeBoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance footage , according to DeBoni , who said Lewis was n't seen getting out of the Audi .\nHowever , Lewis allegedly posted a video to social media earlier that day that showed him driving a vehicle with interior details matching the Audi .\nDeBoni said he was traveling with two individuals whose hooded sweatshirts matched those of the shooters , one of whom was seen with the Draco assault rifle allegedly used in the shooting .\nJaslyn and her father were both struck by the gunfire and taken to Stroger Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead and Adams was treated for a gunshot wound to the torso .\nAdams identified Lewis and another suspect as members of the same gang based on the social media post , which was discovered after he told investigators that Lewis previously threatened him online .\nPolice have said the attack that killed Jaslyn was gang-related and was believed to be tied to another shooting later that day that wounded two people at a Popeyes in Humboldt Park .\nAll three suspects in the video were identified as associates by a detective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an apartment in Lombard using a Facebook account , said DeBoni .\nOfficers on Thursday set up surveillance at the apartment complex , where they noticed the Audi and saw Lewis leave with a backpack and get into a stolen Dodge Durango .\nWhen cops in two “ covert ” vehicles attempted to box in the Durango , Lewis repeatedly hit a parked car until he was able to get free , DeBoni said .\nLewis ultimately smashed into another police vehicle and led officers on a chase through the suburbs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lost control somewhere between Mannheim Road and 25th Avenue and crashed into a concrete barrier on the shoulder , DeBoni said .\nStill carrying the backpack , Lewis crossed multiple lanes of traffic and approached a silver Land Rover carrying five people , including children .\nLewis flashed a 40-caliber handgun and ordered the occupants out before banging on the driver ’ s window , DeBoni said .\nLewis then fired a shot at the window , causing it to shatter .\nNo one was struck , but DeBoni said the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passenger in the back was “ unable to exit with her children in the car seats on either side of her.\n” An officer who heard the shot saw Lewis pull the driver out of the SUV , DeBoni said .\nWhile ordering Lewis to raise his hands , the officer noticed the handgun underneath his thigh as he sat in the SUV .\nAs Lewis refused to comply with the officers ’ orders and made motions toward the gun , the Land Rover began rolling backward .\nIn the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five shots and struck Lewis in his left shoulder , DeBoni said .\nThe handgun was recovered with a bullet in the chamber and 18 more in an extended magazine , DeBoni said .\nThe Draco was found in Lewis ’ backpack with 18 live cartridges .\nDeBoni said the rounds collected at the scene of Jaslyn ’ s killing matched the guns .\nLewis has a lengthy juvenile record , including two pending cases in which he faces charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle , criminal damage to property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steve Greenberg , said his client lives with his grandmother and suffers from mental health issues while urging Judge David Navarro to grant him bail .\nIn turn , Navarro denied Lewis bail .\nHis next court date was set for Thursday .",

         "Access, travel rules influence missionary vaccine policies. The International Mission Board is requiring its missionaries get the COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 vaccine refusal rates may be high among white evangelical Christians , but the International Mission Board — which deploys thousands of missionaries — is not hesitant about the shot .\nThe global agency of the Southern Baptist Convention , the largest evangelical Protestant denomination in the U.S. , announced this month it is requiring vaccinations for missionaries they 're sending into the field amid the pandemic .\nThe IMB may be the first U.S. missionary agency known to have such a mandate , according to leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach the issue in a variety of ways including limiting where people can serve and making considerations for uneven global access to the vaccines .\n“ This is a very common-sense decision , ” said Ed Stetzer , a Southern Baptist who is dean of Mission , Ministry and Leadership at Wheaton College .\n“ Mission-sending agencies from the United States have the real opportunity to be vaccinated , and they ’ re going to places around the world that don ’ t. ” The IMB policy applies to both current and future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmong the reasons it cited for the measure are health concerns and the fact that increasing numbers of countries are implementing their own vaccine requirements — some field personnel have reported needing to show proof to board airplanes and subways or enter restaurants and malls .\nIn a statement announcing the policy , IMB leaders acknowledged that it could be a deal-breaker for some people considering missionary work or currently serving with the organization .\nThe Rev .\nAllen Nelson IV , a pastor who leads a Southern Baptist congregation in Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is completely opposed to mandates for missionaries .\n“ This is something that must be left up to a person ’ s own conscience , research and discussions with a doctor , as well as their particular ministry context , ” Nelson told The Associated Press .\nAmong religious groups that have stopped short of issuing vaccine mandates is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , widely known as the Mormon church , which is giving unvaccinated missionaries assignments in their home countries .\nThe United Methodist Church , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get vaccinated but does not require it .\nThat is partly because availability is not consistent around the world , according to Judy Chung , executive director of missionary services for the denomination ’ s Global Ministries .\n“ We have discussed how to promote vaccination without making a mandatory requirement , '' Chung said , `` because some may not have access to that yet.\n” The denomination currently has about 240 full-time missionaries serving in 70 countries , and the most recently deployed cohort of about 40 has a vaccination rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that our missionary population are safe so that they can focus on the mission work that has been assigned to them , ” Chung said .\n“ We want to make sure that we are not causing harm as we engage in mission.\n” A key question for U.S.-based mission groups is whether they will fall under the Biden administration 's recently announced rule that companies with more than 100 employees must require workers be vaccinated for the coronavirus or undergo weekly testing .\nIf they do , Ted Esler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an association that includes hundreds of missionary agencies in the U.S. and Canada , said about 30 % of those agencies could be affected .\nHe thinks they would comply with the federal mandate but said the issue is not currently stirring much discussion .\nUltimately , he noted , organizations ' internal rules may be rendered moot by vaccine entry requirements that many countries have instituted for visitors .\n“ Whether you have a policy or not , '' Esler said , `` if you ’ re going to serve cross-culturally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be faced with the government regulation.\n” A June survey by the Public Religion Research Institute showed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreasing and acceptance growing , but refusal rates holding steady .\nIt also found significant variance of opinion between people from different faith traditions .\nWhite evangelical Protestants had the highest vaccine refusal rate at 24 % and among the lowest acceptance rates at 56 % .\nBy comparison , acceptance rates stood at 56 % for Hispanic Protestants , 65 % for Latter-day Saints , 66 % for Black Protestants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 74 % for white mainline Protestants .\nThe IMB has had vaccine requirements for other diseases in place since the 1980s , and it says some have chosen to skip international service because of it .\nEsler , who served as a missionary in Bosnia in the 1990s with the Pioneers organization , said he had to be inoculated against diseases like diphtheria , polio , tetanus and typhoid before he could go .\nEsler wasn ’ t eager to get a COVID-19 vaccine and is hesitant to advise others to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated because he is continuing to travel .\n“ From my perspective , this is an issue more because of the fact that it ’ s COVID-related than it is vaccine-related , ” Esler said .\n“ It ’ s unfortunate that the COVID vaccine here is controversial and rejected by some , '' he added , `` when in other places it would be coveted and highly sought-after and they can not get it.\n” ——— Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through The Conversation U.S .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .",

Ron Johnson held a news conference with families who shared stories about the injuries they ’ d suffered as a result of taking the COVID jab .\nYou can watch the hour-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed , above .\nWhile Johnson is diplomatic , stating that most people have no problem after taking the jab , and that the shots have saved many lives , it seems clear that side effects from the COVID injections are FAR more common than anyone is willing to publicly admit .\nCase in point : September 10 , 2021 , WXYZ-TV Channel 7 posted a request on Facebook,1,2 asking people who had lost an unvaccinated loved one to COVID-19 to contact them for a story .\nAs of September 29 , 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments , and the vast majority are about someone who was injured or died from the COVID shot , or who got severe COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated .\nYou can browse through the hundreds of thousands of comments here .\nBelow are some examples of the comments posted on the site : These responses are what you would call a major CLUE .\nAs noted by one commenter , “ Doesn ’ t sound like you ’ re getting the story you need judging by the vast majority of these comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is such an overwhelming outpouring of vaccine reactions maybe do a story on that ?\nThere ’ s lots of people here to pool from it seems.\n” We now also have medical insiders blowing the whistle , confirming COVID jab injuries are incredibly commonplace , and most are never reported .\nIn an upcoming article , I will share businessman Steve Kirsch ’ s analysis that strongly suggests the reports in the U.S .\nVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) is underreported by a factor of 41 .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 deaths and up to 5 million COVID jab injuries .\nIn a stunning Project Veritas report , Jodi O ’ Malley , a nurse working for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , reveals health officials are ignoring and covering up COVID-19 vaccine injuries .\nO ’ Malley says she ’ s seen “ dozens of people come in with adverse reactions , ” including myocarditis , congestive heart failure and deaths , yet the reactions are not being reported .\nThis , despite the fact that both the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require any suspected injury from an emergency use vaccine to be reported .\nOne of the reasons O ’ Malley decided to come forward , knowing she will likely lose her job over it , is because one of her coworkers who was coerced into taking the shot died .\n“ Nobody should have to decide between their livelihood or take the vaccine , ” O ’ Malley says .\nShe also points out that while there are medications such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus , the HHS will terminate anyone who uses these drugs .\nWere these drugs permitted , the COVID jab wouldn ’ t even qualify for emergency use .\nWhen O ’ Malley asks Gayle Lundberg , a DHHS pharmacist , if ivermectin can be given to a patient if the doctor is willing to prescribe it , Lundberg responds : “ This is evil at the highest level , ” O ’ Malley says .\n“ You have the FDA , the CDC , that are both supposed to be protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and everything we ’ ve done so far is unscientific.\n” Another whistleblower , Deborah Conrad , was recently featured in a Highwire exclusive .\nConrad , a physician ’ s assistant , reveals there ’ s a complete disregard for the requirement to report COVID jab injuries at her hospital too .\nI will publish that interview this coming Friday , October 8 , 2021 .\nIn Part 3 of its COVID vaccine investigative series , Project Veritas exposes the true sentiments of two Johnson & Johnson officials : Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business lead , and Justin Durrant , a Johnson & Johnson scientist .\nSpeaking to an undercover Project Veritas reporter over a meal , Schadt admits he does not agree with the push to vaccinate children .\n“ Kids shouldn ’ t get a f*cking [ COVID ] vaccine , ” he says .\n“ It ’ s terrible … It ’ s a kid , you just don ’ t do that , you know ?\nNot something that ’ s so unknown in terms of repercussions down the road.\n” When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the long-term repercussions are , he replies , “ I mean , how could you ?\nRight ?\nThere ’ s nobody who ’ s 30 years in who said , ‘ Hey , I had the vaccine and I don ’ t have a third eyeball.\n” When asked if we can trust the media when it comes to reporting on the COVID shots , Schadt states , “ In no capacity should we ever trust anything that they say.\n” Durrant also doesn ’ t think babies and young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn ’ t make that much of a difference ” if children are unvaccinated for COVID .\nThat said , he does seem to be onboard with the corporate policy to push the injection on adults , regardless of need or personal beliefs .\nHe admits that what they ’ re doing is making life so inconvenient for the unvaccinated that they just give up and get it .\nDespite that , Durrant tells the undercover reporter : “ Don ’ t get the Johnson & Johnson [ COVID vaccine ] .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] though.\n” In late April 2021 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added a warning label to the Janssen COVID shot about the risk for potentially serious blood clotting in the brain and other sites , including the abdomen and legs , in combination with thrombocytopenia ( low platelet count ) , particularly among women.3,4 In mid-July , Guillain-Barre syndrome and altered immunocompetence were added to the list of warnings.5,6 In

adults.7 June 24 , 2021 , Fierce Pharma reported that “ heart inflammation has occurred at a rate of 12.6 per million among those aged 12 to 39 , according to the CDC ’ s Vaccine Safety Datalink.\n” 8 One of the side effects that has yet to register on the FDA ’ s and CDC ’ s radar is menstrual irregularities among women .\nAccording to a September 16 , 2021 , editorial in The BMJ,9 more than 30,000 reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been filed with the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ’ s ( MHRA ) Yellow Card Scheme , which collects and monitors adverse vaccine reactions , as of September 2 , 2021 .\nThe editorial was written by Victoria Male , a reproductive immunology specialist at the Imperial College of London .\nAccording to Male , the link between these bleeding irregularities and the COVID jabs , irrespective of brand , is a plausible one that warrants further investigation .\nShe writes:10 Assistant professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute immune activation and menstrual repair mechanisms , told The Defender she ’ s “ dismayed that the research design of [ COVID ] vaccine trials makes it impossible at this time to actually explore this relationship , and hope drug and vaccine manufacturers in the future take these considerations into account.\n” 11 In the U.S. , the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) had logged a total of 9,589 reports of menstrual disorders following a COVID injection as of September 17 , 2021.12 Dr. Lawrence Palevsky , a pediatrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , telling The Defender:13 Palevsky believes the menstrual irregularities reported by women who have gotten the COVID shot may be related to effects from the spike protein that their bodies are now producing .\nIn early September 2021 , the Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Research on Women ’ s Health , both of which are part of the National Institutes of Health , announced they will award $ 1.67 million in grants to five research institutions to investigate the link between menstrual irregularities and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers at Boston University , Harvard Medical School , Johns Hopkins University , Michigan State University and Oregon Health and Science University , will try to determine whether the menstrual changes are directly linked to the COVID shots , how long the changes last , and what the underlying mechanism is .\nThe five studies are expected to enroll somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 participants , according to Dr. Diana Bianchi , director of the Institute of Child Health and Human Development .\nThere ’ s also an independent group that is collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal bleeding patterns after coming into close contact with a COVID jabbed individual .\nPalevsky and Dr. Christiane Northrup are part of this research group , among others .\nYou can find more information about this project on MyCycleStory.com.16 In closing , while authorities insist the COVID shots are “ safe and effective , ” mounting data tell a different story .\nNot only are the injections losing effectiveness within months , as demonstrated by Israeli data discussed in the video above , VAERS has also received more than 726,960 adverse events reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths and 66,642 hospitalizations , as of September 17 , 2021.17 These numbers are so staggering , there ’ s really nothing that can compare .\nIn nine months , these shots have caused more VAERS reports of injury and death in the United States than all available vaccines over the past 30 years .\nA similar situation can be seen in the U.K. , where 30,305 people have died within 21 days of their COVID shot .\nAnd that was just within the first six months of the vaccine rollout.18 In August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended the use of 1.63 million doses of Moderna ’ s injection after finding foreign substances that looked like metal particles in some vials .\nThen , in mid-September , suspected contaminants were discovered in a particular lot of Pfizer ’ s injection as well.19 Still , we ’ re told to just roll up our sleeves and ask no questions .\nWhy ?\nAs noted by Schadt , the Johnson & Johnson employee caught on tape by Project Veritas , the mass vaccination campaign isn ’ t really about public health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeyond that , I believe it ’ s about building the control mechanism needed for the Great Reset .\nVaccine passports will allow unelected technocrats to control and manipulate the whole world according to their own whims .\nAs expected , it doesn ’ t end with two doses .\nIn Israel , a fourth Pfizer shot is already being rolled out , and the year isn ’ t even over yet .\nAnd all those who took the first two doses will now lose all of their freedoms all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended boosters .\nThis is precisely what we can expect to happen everywhere else in the world , where vaccine passports are rolled out .\nFreedoms are being tied to being up-to-date on your vaccinations , and once COVID-19 disappears , if ever , they ’ ll just come out with something else that must be injected into you if you want to work , go to school , travel , shop or live a semi-normal life .\nThis is what the new biosecurity state is built around .\nThe question is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that how we want to live ?\nIs this the world we want for our children and grandchildren ?\nIf not , we must all do our part and resist mandates , vaccine passports and restrictions based on vaccine status .\nThe good news is , together we can win , because there are far more of us than there are of them .",

         "Considerations on the Great Reset and the New World Order. Considerations on the Great Reset and the New World Order For more than a year and a half we have been helplessly witnessing the succession of incongruent events to which most of us are unable to give a plausible justification .\nThe pandemic emergency has made particularly evident the contradictions and illogicalities of measures nominally intended to limit contagion – lockdowns , curfews , closures of commercial activities , limitations of public services and classes , suspension of citizens ’ rights – but which are disavowed daily by conflicting voices , by clear evidence of ineffectiveness , by contradictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is no need to list the measures that almost all the governments of the world have taken without achieving the promised results .\nIf we limit ourselves to the presumed advantages that the experimental gene serum should have brought to the community – above all immunity to the virus and renewed freedom of movement – we discover that an Oxford University study published in The Lancet stated that the viral load of those vaccinated with a double dose is 251 times greater than the first strains of the virus , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi , according to whom “ whoever gets vaccinated lives , whoever does not get the vaccine dies.\n” The side effects of the gene serum , cleverly disguised or deliberately not registered by the national health authorities , seem to confirm the danger of taking the vaccine and the disturbing unknowns for the health of citizens which we will soon have to face .\nThe art of medicine – which is not science , but the application of scientific principles to different cases each time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have renounced its prudence , in the name of an emergency that has risen to the level of priesthood of a religion – the religion of science , in fact – which in order to be such has cloaked itself in a dogmatism bordering on superstition .\nThe ministers of this cult have constituted themselves as a caste of untouchables , exempt from any criticism even when their claims are denied by the evidence of the facts .\nThe principles of medicine , considered universally valid until February 2020 , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of being advised to vaccinate at the height of the pandemic , the obligation of masks being imposed although they are useless , the arbitrary mandating of bizarre distances , the prohibition of treatments with effective drugs and the imposition of experimental gene therapies in violation of normal safety protocols .\nAnd just as there are new Covid priests , so there are also new heretics , that is , those who reject the new pandemic religion and want to remain faithful to the Hippocratic Oath .\nNot infrequently , the aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less titled scientists does not seem to be questioned due to their conflicts of interest or by the substantial financial benefits received by pharmaceutical companies , which under normal conditions would be scandalous and criminal .\nWhat many fail to understand is the inconsistency between the stated aims and the means that are adopted in a constantly changing manner in order to achieve them .\nIf in Sweden the absence of lockdowns and masks did not lead to higher infection rates than those in countries where people have been confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks put on even in primary schools , this element is not considered as proof of ineffectiveness of the measures .\nIf in Israel or in Great Britain mass vaccination has increased infections and made them more virulent , their example does not induce the rulers of other countries to be cautious in the vaccination campaign , but rather pushes them to evaluate the mandatory nature of their giving of the vaccine .\nIf ivermectin or hyperimmune plasma prove to be valid treatments , this is not enough to authorize them , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder the reason for this disconcerting irrationality end up refraining from judgment , giving a sort of fideistic acceptance to the pronouncements of the Covid priests , or conversely considering doctors as unreliable sorcerers .\nAs I said earlier , we are faced with a colossal deception , based on lies and fraud .\nThis deception starts from the premise that the justifications put forward by the authorities in support of their actions are sincere .\nMore simply , the mistake consists in believing that the rulers are honest and in assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we persist in finding more or less plausible justifications , with the sole purpose of not recognizing that we are the object of a conspiracy planned to the smallest detail .\nAnd while we try to rationally explain irrational behavior , while we attribute logic to the illogical actions of those who govern us , cognitive dissonance leads us to close our eyes to reality and to believe the most shameless lies .\nOnce it is understood that the present events have been intended in order to obtain certain results – and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a minority part of humanity , with incalculable harm for the majority – we must also have the honesty to recognize the criminal mens [ mind ] of the authors of this plan .\nThis criminal design also makes us understand the fraud perpetrated by civil authority in presenting certain measures as an unavoidable response to unpredictable events , when the events have been artfully created and magnified with the sole purpose of legitimizing a revolution – which Schwab identifies as the fourth industrial revolution – intended by the elite to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority is on the other hand the result of a process that began even earlier , with the French Revolution , and which made the political class the servant not of God ( whose Lordship it disdainfully disregards ) nor of the sovereign people ( which it despises and uses only to legitimize itself ) , but of the economic and financial potentates , of the international oligarchy of bankers and usurers , of multinationals and pharmaceutical companies .\nIn reality , on closer inspection , all these subjects belong to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEqual enslavement is also evident in the media : journalists have accepted – without any scruple of conscience – prostituting themselves to the powerful , going so far as to censor the truth and spread shameless lies without even trying to give them the appearance of credibility .\nUp until last year journalists counted the numbers of the “ victims ” of Covid by presenting anyone who tested positive as terminally ill ; today those who die after being vaccinated are always and only taken by a vague “ illness , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they officially decide that there is no correlation between a person ’ s death and the administration of the gene serum .\nThey twist the truth with impunity when it does not confirm their narrative , bending it to fit their purposes .\nWhat has been happening for a year and a half had been widely announced , down to the smallest detail , by the creators of the Great Reset themselves ; just as we were told the measures that would be adopted .\nOn February 17 , 1950 , testifying before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker James Warburg said , “ We will have a world government , whether you like it or not .\nThe only question that arises is whether this world government will be established by consensus or by force.\n” Four years later , the Bilderberg Group was born , which has counted among its members characters such as [ Italian businessman Gianni ] Agnelli , Henry Kissinger , Mario Monti , and the current Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi .\nIn 1991 , David Rockefeller wrote : “ The world is ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an intellectual elite and world bankers is certainly preferable to the national self-determination practiced in past centuries.\n” And he added : “ We are on the verge of a global transformation .\nAll we need is the ‘ right ’ global crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.\n” Today we can affirm that this “ right crisis ” coincides with the pandemic emergency and with the “ lockstep ” outlined since 2010 by the Rockefeller Foundation document “ Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now witnessing are all anticipated .\nIn short , they have created a false problem in order to be able to impose population control measures as an apparent solution , cancel small and medium-sized businesses with lockdowns and the green pass to the benefit of a few international groups , demolish education by imposing distance learning , lower the cost of manpower and employees with “ smart working , ” privatize public health for the benefit of Big Pharma , and allow governments to use the state of emergency to legislate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines on the entire population , making citizens traceable in all their movements and either chronically ill or sterile .\nEverything the elite wanted to do , they have done .\nAnd what is incomprehensible is that in the face of the evidence of the premeditation of this terrible crime against humanity , which sees the leaders of almost the whole world as accomplices and traitors , there is not a single magistrate who opens a file against them to ascertain the truth and condemn the guilty and complicit .\nThose who disagree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as public enemies , as infectors , as non-persons for whom no rights are recognized .\nNow , in the face of a criminal plan it would be at least logical to denounce it and make it known , in order to then be able to avert it and try those who are guilty .\nThe list of traitors should start with the heads of government , with cabinet members and elected officials , and then continue with the virologists and corrupt doctors , the complicit officials , the leaders of the armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution , the sold-out journalists , the cowardly judges and the obsequious unions .\nIn that long list that will perhaps be drawn up one day , the leaders of the Catholic Church should also be listed , starting with Bergoglio and not a few of the Bishops , who have become zealous executors of the will of the prince against the mandate received from Christ .\nAnd certainly , in that list , one would know the extent of the conspiracy and the number of the conspirators , confirming the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious power .\nIn short , it would be understood that the corrupt part of the civil authority – the deep state – and the corrupt part of ecclesiastical authority – the deep church – are two sides of the same coin , both instrumental to the establishment of the New World Order .\nHowever , in order to understand this alliance between civil and religious power , it is necessary to recognize the spiritual and eschatological dimension of the present conflict , framing it in the context of the war that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has waged against God .\nThis war , whose outcomes have been decided ab æterno with the inexorable defeat of Satan and the Antichrist and the overwhelming victory of the Woman encircled with the stars , is now approaching its conclusion .\nThis is why the forces of darkness are so wild at present , so impatient to cancel the name of Our Lord from the earth , to not only destroy his tangible presence in our cities by tearing down churches , demolishing crosses , and suppressing Christian holidays ; but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adulterating its teaching , and debasing its worship .\nAnd in order to do this , the presence of a faithful and courageous Hierarchy , ready to suffer martyrdom in order to defend Christian faith and moral teaching , is certainly an obstacle .\nThis is why , from the very initial phase of the globalist plan , it was essential to corrupt the Hierarchy in morals and doctrine , to infiltrate it with fifth columns and sleeper cells , to deprive it of any supernatural yearning , and to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual scandals ; all with the purpose of excluding it and eliminating it once its purpose has been achieved , according to established practice .\nThis infiltration operation began at the end of the 1950 ’ s , when the project of the New World Order was just taking shape .\nIt began its own work of subversion a few years later , with the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , in view of which the election of Roncalli and the expulsion of Cardinal Siri , Pacelli ’ s “ dauphin ” or probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for enthusiasm both for the progressive and modernist element within the Church , as well as for the communist , liberal , and Masonic element of the civil world .\nVatican II represented within the ecclesial body what the Tennis Court Oath [ of the French Revolution ] was for civil society : the beginning of the Revolution .\nAnd if on many occasions I have drawn attention to the subversive nature of the Council , today I believe that a historical analysis deserves attention in which apparently disconnected facts acquire a disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael J. Matt has reported in a recent video at The Remnant , today we are beginning to put together all the pieces of the mosaic , and we discover – by the very admission of one of the protagonists – that Msgr .\nHélder Câmara , Archbishop of Olinda and Recife in Brazil , had a meeting in those years with the young Klaus Schwab , the founder of the World Economic Forum and theorizer of the Great Reset .\nOnce Schwab recognized Câmara for his opposition to the traditional Church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited him to the Davos Forum , considering his participation in this event as extremely important in view of the project of the New Order .\nWe know that Hélder Câmara was among the organizers of the “ Pact of the Catacombs , ” which was signed by about forty ultra-progressivist Bishops on 16 November 1965 , a few days before the closing of the Council .\nAmong the heretical theses of that document , there is also collaboration in the establishment of “ another , new social order ” n. 9 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not surprised to learn that among the signatories there was also Msgr .\nEnrique Angelelli , the auxiliary bishop of Cordoba in Argentina , “ [ a ] point of reference for then-Father Jorge Mario Bergoglio ” .\nBergoglio himself declared right from the beginning of his Pontificate that he agreed with the demands of the Pact of the Catacombs .\nOn 20 October 2019 , during the Synod on the Amazon , the celebration of the pact between the conspirators was repeated in the Catacombs of Santa Domitilla , confirming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found fulfillment precisely in Jorge Mario Bergoglio .\nFar from distancing himself from the ultra-progressivists who support him and who determined his election at the last Conclave , Bergoglio never misses an opportunity to give proof of his perfect coherence with the plan of the New World Order , beginning with the collaboration of Vatican commissions and dicasteries with environmentalism of a Malthusian matrix and their participation in the Council for Inclusive Capitalism , a global alliance with the Rothschilds , the Rockefeller Foundation , and large banks .\nSo on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trilateral Commission , and on the other we have Klaus Schwab , who is related by marriage with the Rothschilds ( here ) , with the World Economic Forum , and both of them are arm-in-arm with the head of the Catholic Church to establish the New Order by means of the Great Reset , as has been planned since the 1950 ’ s .\nAmong the associates of this pactum sceleris there must also be counted some members of the Pontifical Academy for Life , which recently had its organizational structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members who were most faithful to the Magisterium , replacing them with supporters of depopulation , contraception , and abortion .\nThere should be no surprise at the Holy See ’ s support for vaccines : in June 2011 the Sovereign Independent carried the headline on its front page : “ Depopulation Through Forced Vaccination : The Zero Carbon Solution !\n” .\nBeside the headline , a photograph of Bill Gates was accompanied by a quote from him : “ The world today has 6.8 billion people .\nThat ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive services [ abortion and contraception ] , we lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.\n” This is what Bill Gates said eleven years ago .\nToday he is one of the shareholders of the Black Rock group that finances the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines , one of the main sponsors of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , and also of a myriad of public and private entities connected to health .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soros , the “ philanthropist ” of the Open Society , which together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently invested in a British company that produces swabs for Covid testing .\nAnd since we are talking about economic issues , I would like to recall that the Holy See has held shares worth about €20 million in two pharmaceutical companies that have produced a contraceptive drug , and more recently it invested in a fund that guaranteed very high profits in the event of a geopolitical or pandemic crisis thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geo-Risk ” fund managed by the Merrill Lynch investment bank , which had to close it because of its skyrocketing yields after the first few months of the pandemic .\nOther capital , coming from the “ Peter ’ s Pence ” collection , had been used to finance various other initiatives , even collaborating with [ Italian businessman ] Lapo Elkann , whose endeavors include Rocketman , the autobiographical film of Elton John .\nTo say nothing of the real estate speculations and the purchase of the London building at 60 Sloane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed us on , a purchase that I know , from a reliable source , was decided on by Bergoglio himself .\nAnd then there ’ s China : always in the name of “ coherence ” and the “ church of the poor for the poor ” that is so dear to Bergoglio ’ s heart , there are those who believe that the secret Accord prepared by the Jesuits and former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick may have obtained substantial funding from the communist regime in Beijing in exchange for the Vatican ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violation of human rights .\nThere have been manifold examples of interference by the deep state in the life of the Church .\nWe can not forget the emails of John Podesta and Hillary Clinton , which show the intention to oust Benedict XVI from the papacy and so to initiate a new “ springtime of the Church ” that would be progressivist and globalist , which later came about with the resignation of Benedict and the election of the Argentine .\nNor can we overlook the interference of entities and institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the B ’ nai B ’ rith , in dictating the direction of the “ renewal ” of the Church after Vatican II and most of all under this Pontificate .\nFinally , we should remember on the one hand the disdainful refusals to grant audiences to conservative political and institutional personalities , and on the other hand the passionate smiling encounters with leaders of the Left and of progressivism , along with expressions of enthusiastic satisfaction on the occasion of their election .\nMany of them owe their success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society of Jesus or circles of Catholicism that in Italy would be called Dossettian,1 where the network of social and political relations constitutes a sort of progressive Freemasonry and ensures dazzling careers for so-called “ adult Catholics , ” those who use the name “ Christian ” without behaving consistently with Christian faith and morality in their service of public affairs : Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi ; Romano Prodi , Mario Monti , Giuseppe Conte , and Mario Draghi ; to name only a few .\nAs we can see , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church is long-standing and has now produced the results hoped for by its supporters , with very serious damage to both the State and religion .\nThe closure of churches in early 2020 , even before the civil authorities imposed the lockdowns ; the prohibition of the celebration of Masses and the administration of the Sacraments during the pandemic emergency ; the grotesque ceremony performed on 27 March 2020 in Saint Peter ’ s Square ; the insistence on vaccines and their promotion as morally legitimate despite having been produced with cell lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s declarations that the genetic serum represents a “ moral duty ” for every Christian ; the introduction of the “ Green Pass ” health passport in the Vatican and more recently in Catholic schools and in some seminaries ; the Holy See prohibiting Bishops from announcing that they are against the vaccination obligation , promptly endorsed by certain Bishops ’ Conferences – these are all elements that demonstrate the subordination of the deep church to the orders of the deep state , and the way in which the Bergoglian church is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we combine all this with the idolatrous cult of the pachamama right under the arches of Saint Peter ’ s Basilica ; the insistence on irenicist ecumenism , pacifism , and pauperism ; the endorsement of situation ethics and the substantial legitimization of adultery and concubinage in Amoris Laetitia ; the declaration that the death penalty is morally illicit ; the endorsement of left-wing politicians , revolutionary leaders , and abortion activists ; the words of understanding for LGBT issues , homosexuals , and transsexuals ; the silence over the legitimization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence over the blessing of sodomitical couples by German Bishops and priests ; and the prohibition of the Tridentine Mass with the abolition of Benedict XVI ’ s Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum , we realize that Jorge Mario Bergoglio is carrying out the task entrusted to him by the globalist elite , which wants him to be the liquidator of the Catholic Church and the founder of a philanthropic and ecumenical sect of Masonic inspiration that is meant to constitute the Universal Religion in support of the New Order .\nWhether this action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of fear , or under blackmail , nothing detracts from the gravity of what is happening , nor from the moral responsibility of those who promote it .\nThe Luciferian matrix of the New World Order At this point , it is necessary to clarify what is meant by the “ New World Order , ” or rather what its creators mean , regardless of what they say publicly .\nBecause on the one hand , it is true that there is a project , that certain people conceived it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the other hand it is also true that the inspiring principles of the project are not always disclosed , or at least they can not be openly admitted to be closely related to what is happening today , since such an admission would arouse opposition even from those who are the most peaceful and moderate .\nIt is one thing to impose the “ Green Pass ” with the excuse of the pandemic ; but it is quite another to recognize that the purpose of the passport is to accustom us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that this total control is the “ mark of the Beast ” of which the Book of the Apocalypse speaks ( Rev 13:16-18 ) .\nThe reader will forgive me if , in order to demonstrate my argument , I must resort to using quotations of such gravity and wickedness that they arouse bewilderment and horror – but this is necessary if we are to understand what the real intentions of the architects of this plot really are , and the true nature of the epochal battle they are waging against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the esoteric roots of the thought that lies at the foundation of the United Nations , once longed for by [ 19th-century Italian political activist ] Giuseppe Mazzini , we can not fail to consider characters such as Albert Pike , Eliphas Levi , Helena Blavatsky , Alice Ann Bailey , or other disciples of Luciferian sects .\nTheir writings , published since the late nineteenth century , are quite revealing .\nAlbert Pike , a friend of Mazzini and a fellow Freemason , gave an address in 1889 in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was then reprinted on 19 January 1935 by the English journal The Freemason .\nPike declared : This profession of faith in the divinity of Satan is not only an admission of who the real Great Architect that Freemasonry adores is , but also a blasphemous political project that passe through the ecumenism of Vatican II , whose first theorist was Freemasonry : And the identity of the “ only god who is above all the other gods ” has been well explained in the preceding quotation .\nIn another letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not escape notice that the “ great heresy of separativeness ” sounds curiously in agreement with the ecumenism condemned by Pius XI in his Encyclical Mortalium Animos , an ecumenism that was adopted by the Declaration Dignitatis Humanae and recently merged into the doctrine of “ inclusivity ” formulated by those who allowed idolatrous worship to the pachamama to be offered in Saint Peter ’ s Basilica .\nIt is clear that the term “ separativeness ” intends to designate in a negative key the necessary separation of good from evil , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wrong that constitutes the criterion of moral judgment of human behavior .\n“ Inclusivity ” opposes this distinction , allowing oneself to be deliberately contaminated by evil to adulterate the good , equating the true and the false in order to corrupt the former and give legitimacy to the latter .\nIf one does not understand that the ideological roots of ecumenism are intrinsically linked to Masonic Luciferian esoterism , one can not grasp the connection that links the doctrinal deviations of Vatican II to the plan of the New World Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad example of those pacifist and ecumenist ambitions , in which the “ Age of Aquarius ” was celebrated by the musical Hair ( 1969 ) and then by John Lennon with Imagine ( 1971 ) : This manifesto of Masonic nihilism can be considered the hymn of globalism and the new universal religion : it is no coincidence that it was used as the theme song for the 2012 Olympic Games in London , and more recently for those in Tokyo .\nA soul that is not led astray can only feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same is true for the words of Lennon ’ s no-less-blasphemous song God ( 1970 ) : I understand that for many it is distressing to accept that the Hierarchy may have allowed itself to be deceived by its enemies , making their requests their own in questions that touch the very soul of the Church .\nIt is certain that there were Masonic prelates who succeeded in introducing their ideas into the Council by disguising them , but in the full awareness that they would inexorably lead to the realization of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the establishment of the New Era – the Age of Aquarius – in which Our Lord is banished from society in order to welcome the Antichrist .\nOne can then understand the winking indulgence given to Freemasonry by many Catholic personalities – I am thinking of Cardinals Martini and Ravasi , among the many – and their opposition to the excommunications that the Popes renewed against the sect .\nOne also understands the reason for the enthusiasm of the Masonic Lodges at the election of Bergoglio , and conversely their ill-concealed hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kathèkon [ “ the one who restrains ” ( cfr .\n2 Thess 6:7 ) ] to be eliminated .\nIt should also be remembered , with some embarrassment , that certain statements by Ratzinger suggest an attempt to “ Christianize ” the globalist project , without condemning it as antichristic and anti-Christian : These words , unfortunately , confirm the fallacy of Hegelian thought , which influenced the professor from Tubingen right up to the Throne .\nCertainly the Pontiff ’ s failure to take a position permitted him to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globalist plan , if Italian President Giorgio Napolitano was able to affirm in his 2006 year-end address speech to the Italian people : “ There is harmony between Pope Benedict and me in supporting a New World Order ” ( 31 December 2006 ) .\nOn the other hand , the Hegelian process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis echoes the motto of alchemy , Solve et Coagula , which was adopted by Freemasonry and by Luciferian esoterism .\nIt is the motto that appears on the arms of Baphomet , the infernal idol adored by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is admitted by its most authoritative members .\nIn his essay Lucifer Rising , Philip Jones specifies that the Hegelian dialectic “ combines a form of Christianity as thesis with a pagan spiritualism as antithesis , with the result of a synthesis that is very similar to the Babylonian mystery religions.\n” Ecumenism is one of the key themes of globalist thought .\nThis is confirmed by Robert Muller , who was the Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations : “ We must move as quickly as possible towards a one-world government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single world leader.\n” Before him , one of the advocates of the League of Nations , Arthur Balfour , created the “ Synthetic Society , ” which had as its purpose the creation of the “ one-world religion.\n” Pierre Theilard de Chardin himself , a Jesuit heretic condemned by the Holy Office and today a celebrated theologian of progressivism , considered the United Nations as “ the progressivist institutional incarnation of his philosophy , ” expressing his hope that “ a general convergence of religions on a universal Christ who fulfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only possible conversion of the world , and the only form in which a religion of the future can be conceived ” in order to “ reduce the gap between pantheism and Christianity by drawing out what could be called the Christian soul of Pantheism or the pantheistic aspect of Christianity.\n” It will not escape notice that the pachamama and the attribution of Marian connotations to Mother Earth turns these concepts of Theilard de Chardin into a disturbing reality .\nAnd that ’ s not all : Robert Muller , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theosophist Alice A. Bailey , declares : “ Teilhard de Chardin influenced his companion [ the Jesuit Father Emmanuel Saguez de Breuvery , who held important positions at the UN ] , who in turn inspired his colleagues , and they in turn initiated a rich process of global and long-term thought within the United Nations , which has affected many nations and people all over the world .\nI was profoundly influenced by Teilhard.\n” In his book The Future of Man , Theilard writes : “ Even if its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity will wake up in a pan-organized world.\n” Muller was the founder of the World Core Curriculum , which aimed “ to orient our children towards global citizenship , earth-centered beliefs , socialist values and the collective mindset , which are becoming a requirement for the work force of the 21st century ” ( New Man Magazine ) .\nAnd if he proudly claims Alice A. Bailey among his inspirers , we discover that she was a disciple of the Theosophic Movement founded by Helena Blavatsky , a declared Luciferian .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , here are a few citations from her writings : And , almost anticipating the pachamama : And last but not least : It was Alice A. Bailey who founded the Lucifer Publishing Company , which is now known as the Lucis Publishing Company , closely related to the Lucis Trust , formerly the Lucifer Trust , recognized as an NGO by the United Nations .\nIf we add to this heap of infernal ramblings the words of David Spangler , the Director of the Planetary Initiative Project of the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat that is hanging over all of us : Alice A. Bailey writes about the New Age : Today we see how the teaching methods theorized by Muller in the World Core Curriculum have been adopted by almost all nations , including LGBT ideology , gender theory , and all other forms of indoctrination .\nThis is confirmed by the former director of the WHO , Dr. Brock Chisolm , explaining what the UN educational policy would like to achieve : Behold once again the fil rouge that links not only Klaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Muller and Alice A. Bailey to Pierre Theilard de Chardin and Emmanuel Saguez de Breuvery , always in a globalist key and under the ill-omened inspiration of Luciferian thought .\nAn in-depth analysis of these disturbing aspects will make it possible to shed light on the truth and reveal the complicity and betrayals of not a few churchmen who are enslaved to the enemy .\nOur response to the crisis of authority The corruption of authority is such that it is very difficult – at least in human terms – to hypothesize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of history , totalitarian regimes have been overthrown by force .\nIt is difficult to think that the health dictatorship that has been established in recent months can be fought differently , since all the powers of the State , all of the means of information , all the international public and private institutions , all of the economic and financial potentates are complicit in this crime .\nFaced with this bleak scenario of corruption and conflict of interest , it is indispensable that all those who are not subservient to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cohesive front , in order to defend their natural and religious rights , their own health and that of their loved ones , their freedom , and their goods .\nWhere authority fails in its duties and indeed betrays the purpose for which it has been established , disobedience is not only lawful but obligatory : non-violent disobedience , at least for now , but determined and courageous .\nDisobedience to the illegitimate and tyrannical diktats of ecclesiastical authority , wherever it shows itself to be an accomplice of the infernal plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conclude this reflection with a brief spiritual thought .\nEverything that we know , discover , and understand about the global conspiracy currently unfolding shows us a tremendous reality that is also at the same time sharp and clearly-defined : there are two sides , the side of God and the side of Satan , the side of the children of Light and the side of the children of darkness .\nIt is not possible to come to terms with the Enemy , nor is it possible to serve two masters ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Lord must be engraved in our minds : “ Whoever is not with Me is against Me , and whoever does not gather with Me scatters ” ( Mt 12:30 ) .\nHoping to build a world government in which the Divine Kingship of Jesus Christ is outlawed is insane and blasphemous , and no one who has such a plan will ever succeed .\nWhere Christ reigns , peace , harmony and justice reign ; where Christ does not reign , Satan is a tyrant .\nLet us consider this well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make agreements with the adversary in the name of a false peaceful coexistence !\nAnd let those prelates and civil leaders who think that their complicity only affects economic or health issues , pretending not to know what is behind all this , also consider this well .\nLet us turn to Christ , Christ who is the King of hearts , of families , of societies , and of nations .\nLet us proclaim Him as Our King and Mary Most Holy as Our Queen .\nOnly in this way can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order be defeated .\nOnly in this way can the Holy Church be purified of traitors and renegades .\nAnd may God listen to our prayer .",

         "‘Radicalisation’ and the assumption of Muslim manipulability. In an insightful piece for Harper ’ s Magazine , Joseph Bernstein , a senior reporter at BuzzFeed News , questions the idea that disinformation spread on social media platforms in the last five years , rather than long-term societal conditions , is responsible for the crisis of faith in democratic institutions that has swept the West in the age of Brexit and Donald Trump .\nFor example , he argues that “ the mosaic of experiences that form the American attitude towards the expertise of public-health authorities ” is a better explanation for vaccine and mask hesitancy , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why have we been so eager to accept Silicon Valley ’ s story about how easy we are to manipulate ?\n” he asks .\nBernstein traces the presumed power of social media companies to dubious mid-century academic studies , citing sociologist Jacques Ellul who in the 60s wrote that such studies tended to “ regard the buyer as victim and prey ” .\nHowever , conspicuously missing , especially as the anniversary of 9/11 approaches , is the tale of how this view has been supercharged by America ’ s 20-year Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real sense , this is chickens coming home to roost .\nThe idea of “ radicalisation ” , “ counter-radicalisation ” and “ de-radicalisation ” is built on a similar assumption of the manipulability of Muslim societies and people .\nRather than consider that there could be specific grievances underlying the resort of a minority to terrorist violence , the US and the West preferred to blame it on “ radical ” preachers spreading anti-Western propaganda – the Facebook of the Middle East , one might say .\nFaced with a rejection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at worst , honest though tragic innocence , broadcast by mainstream media , governments and academics in Europe and North America found comfort in portraying Muslim populations as simple-minded and easily entrapped by the spells cast by angry , bearded clerics in flowing robes .\nThis is the same view Bernstein is seeing being reproduced in the West itself to understand their own non-compliant populations , a minority of whom also pose serious terrorism threats .\nGovernments with an authoritarian bent in the non-Western world have also latched onto the idea of “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their subjects over their policies .\nThe Kenyan authorities , for example , who for the last six decades have continued the colonial policies of marginalising and oppressing the country ’ s Muslim and especially ethnic Somali population , paid little more than lip service to this history – which has been extensively documented by a Truth , Justice and Reconciliation Commission which collected more than 40,000 witness statements – when confronted with discontent and terrorist attacks committed by local actors .\nEven though 90 percent of such attacks occurred after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was little acknowledgment that may have something to do with it .\nInstead , the history was flipped on its head and the invasion justified on the basis of what it inspired .\nFurther , the government , with the media in tow , took its cue from the US and blamed “ radical ” preachers for the violence , even targeting some for extrajudicial execution .\nThis is not to say that radical preachers extolling violence have no effect – they clearly can influence a small minority of their followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to disinformation on social media platforms in the West and elsewhere , their impact has been greatly exaggerated , and their audiences infantilised , by those with an incentive to do so .\nAgain citing Ellul , Bernstein argues that propaganda or incitement would not be effective without “ pre-propaganda ” – which he equates to the entire social , cultural , political , and historical context .\nOne can think of this context as the soil in which the violent ideas spread by the clerics can take root in particular individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox News or radical preachers can lead to perverse “ solutions ” that entrench problems and privilege “ acceptable ” propaganda .\nIn her excellent talk on the limits of media literacy at the 2018 SXSW EDU conference in Austin , Texas , Danah Boyd , founder of the research institute Data & Society , points out that “ fundamentally , misinformation is contextual ” meaning what constitutes propaganda depends on who is labelling it .\n“ The difference between what is deemed missionary work , education and radicalisation depends a lot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” she says .\nShe argues that the culture wars waged between “ progressives ” and “ conservatives ” in the US are actually arguments over epistemology – how you know what you claim to know – that can not be resolved through fact-checking or compromise .\nShe sees the efforts of many liberal elites to debunk the beliefs of Trump voters as “ assertions of authority over epistemology ” and the propagation of a single , acceptable truth or worldview .\nOn the global stage , where the Global War on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods used to wage them into what Samuel Huntington called “ a clash of civilisations ” , this assertion of a singular truth channelled through Western prophets that negates the experience of much of the rest of the world , has been at the root of de-radicalisation efforts .\nYet , they can have the opposite effect .\nAs Boyd puts it , “ nothing can radicalise someone more than feeling that you are being lied to.\n” The views expressed in this article are the author ’ s own and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial stance .",

Climate action advocates reiterated demands for urgent measures to rein in global heating after the World Meteorological Organization warned Thursday that there 's a 40 % chance the planet will temporarily hit 1.5°C of warming in the next five years .\nThe WMO , a United Nations agency , also said in its update that there 's a 90 % chance at least one year between 2021 and 2025 will be the hottest on the books—a record currently held by 2016 .\n`` We can change course , but the window is closing , '' tweeted climate group 350 Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible .

         "The big problems with the climate pledges that came out of COP26. After more than two weeks of negotiations during the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow , Scotland , diplomats from almost 200 nations finally agreed on two major points : ramp up the fight against climate change and help at-risk countries prepare .\nSpecifically , governments agreed to meet again next in 2022 with more robust plans to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent by 2030 , significantly reduce emissions of methane ( which has even more global warming potential than CO2 ) , and nearly double the aid to poor countries to help them mitigate the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to initiate reductions in coal-fired power and to begin slashing government subsidies on other fossil fuels , representing the first time a COP text mentioned coal and fossil fuels .\nAcknowledging the deal is imperfect , U.S. climate envoy John Kerry registered his support .\n`` You ca n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good , and this is good .\nThis is a powerful statement , '' he said .\n`` We in the United States are really excited by the fact that this raises ambition on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement represents a step forward , it has been roundly criticized by scientists , climate activists and representatives from small , poorer nations who will feel the brunt of the climate impacts much sooner than big , richer ones .\nShauna Aminath , environment minister of the Maldives , denounced the final COP26 deal as `` not in line with the urgency and scale required . ''\nThe Maldives has supported life and human civilization for millennia , but 80 percent of the archipelago of low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean is poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising sea levels caused by global warming .\n`` What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time , '' Aminath said .\n`` It will be too late for the Maldives . ''\n`` COP26 has closed the gap , but it has not solved the problem , '' said Niklas Hoehne , a climate policy expert from Wageningen University in the Netherlands .\nLong before the annual climate chinwag , there was an air of futility about what has been described as our `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a livable environment for future generations .\nHow could there not be ?\nThe leaders of more than 150 countries have been trying to lower humankind 's global warming emissions since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) talks started more than a quarter-century ago .\nAnd since the first summit was held in 1995 , global emissions have , instead , skyrocketed .\nThe summit 's host , UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson—who joined activists in invoking the mantra `` keep 1.5 alive '' —was unimpressed with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( held in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 ) that all the world leaders ' pledges without action were `` starting to sound hollow '' and criticizing their weak commitments as `` drops in a rapidly warming ocean . ''\nScience has put a deadline on us .\nIn order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels—a limit decided by the Paris agreement—humankind must achieve `` net-zero '' emissions ( i.e.\n, whatever amount we emit into the atmosphere , we must also remove ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely .\nBig polluting nations like the United States , China and Russia not only continue to burn fossil fuels at an alarming rate but also continue to drill for more oil .\nChina—the world 's biggest emitter , responsible for more than a quarter of humanity 's total emissions—and Russia have pushed their own net-zero targets to 2060 .\nIndia has pushed it to 2070 .\nThat is kicking the climate can down the field , to be dealt with by future leaders .\n( A quick glance at a graphic created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep drop in emissions that China must undergo to achieve its own target underscores the magnitude , and perhaps folly , of winning the war against the climate crisis . )\nIn the United States , a divided nation has ossified a gridlocked legislature that has n't passed many game-changing climate laws .\nMuch environmental protection has been exercised through executive actions , such as regulations imposed by federal agencies , which can be simply overturned by the next administration .\nWhen a Democrat is in the White House , environmental protection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican is in the White House , it 's more about protecting polluters .\nThe country lacks the necessary strong federal and state climate legislation to protect people and the environment from toxic , global-warming pollution , protect fenceline communities ( which are often poor communities of color and Indigenous communities ) and hold polluters to account .\nOne of the bright spots of the summit was a landmark $ 19 billion agreement between more than 100 nations—together responsible for about 85 percent of the world 's forests—to end deforestation by 2030 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the climate fight as they prevent around one-third of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion .\nBut in a press statement , Dan Zarin , the executive director of forests and climate change at Wildlife Conservation Society , said that the Glasgow Climate Pact `` does not mean that the world has solved the climate crisis . ''\nHe pointed out that even if all the participating nations ' pledges to reduce emissions ( known as `` nationally determined contributions '' or `` NDCs '' ) were achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 percent reduction needed by 2030 to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius .\nIn the Glasgow Climate Pact , countries only agreed to strengthen their NDCs by the end of 2022 .\nPresident Joe Biden , who attended the summit , hailed the forest agreement , which aims to restore almost 500 million acres of ecosystems , including forests , by 2030 .\n`` We 're going to work to ensure markets recognize the true economic value of natural carbon sinks and motivate governments , landowners and stakeholders to prioritize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plan will `` help the world deliver on our shared goal of halting natural forest loss . ''\nBut activists were less enthused .\nThe forest agreement `` is one of those oft repeated attempts to make us believe that deforestation can be stopped and forest can be conserved by pushing billions of dollars into the land and territories of the Indigenous Peoples , '' said Souparna Lahiri of the Global Forest Coalition , an international coalition of NGOs and Indigenous Peoples ' organizations defending the rights of forest peoples .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of Indigenous peoples are relatively weak '' in the Glasgow text , said Jennifer Tauli Corpuz , a lawyer from the Igorot people in the Philippines and chief policy lead at Nia Tero , a nonprofit advocacy group for Indigenous peoples .\nSpecifically , she said that `` [ w ] e will have to watch closely the implementation of [ COP26 's ] new carbon scheme , '' referring to the finalization of rules that will manage the creation of the international carbon market , and were part of the 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of Indigenous representation in the final text of the Glasgow Climate Pact , people from poorer island nations that are most susceptible to the impacts of sea level rise were also underrepresented at the talks , mainly due to COVID-19 restrictions .\nJust three out of 14 climate-vulnerable Pacific island states were able to send delegates to COP26 , while the fossil fuel industry sent more than 500 delegates .\nUltimately , the climate pledges made by nations do not match the climate policies of those nations .\nAnd since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal stimulus to ensure that actual policies line up with those pledges .\n`` The NDCs are voluntary measures , '' said Lakshman Guruswamy , an expert in international environmental law at the University of Colorado-Boulder .\n`` There 's no way of implementing , imposing , or trying to enforce a non-binding agreement . ''\nNo penalties , no legal ramifications , no climate court , no climate police .\nAll people have is civil society .\nIt 's up to us `` regular people '' to stand up , speak up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate and the environment in young people ; and to rethink and retool our own personal behaviors to be in line with the ultimate goals we have for the future .\nThere can be no significant change without both the political will behind candidates who will fight against climate change and public pressure to hold elected officials to their word .\nWhat many engaged citizens in the U.S. do n't realize is that it 's not enough to participate only once every four years by voting in presidential elections .\nReal change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their local communities .\nIt starts at home , with our families , our friends and our neighbors .\nMake no mistake : Our personal decisions as consumers play a decisive role in the state of the global climate .\n`` While large oil companies like ExxonMobil , Shell , BP , and Chevron are the biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions , we consumers are complicit , '' writes Renee Cho , a staff writer for the Columbia Climate School .\n`` We demand the products and energy made from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that 90 percent of fossil fuel companies ' emissions are a result of the products made from fossil fuels . ''\nSadly , according to a recent poll , even though a majority of people believe that climate change is a serious issue , few are actually willing to change their lifestyles to help save the environment .\n`` Citizens are undeniably concerned by the state of the planet , but these findings raise doubts regarding their level of commitment to preserving it , '' according to the survey of 10 countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Kingdom , France and Germany .\n`` Rather than translating into a greater willingness to change their habits , citizens ' concerns are particularly focused on their negative assessment of governments ' efforts… The widespread awareness of the importance of the climate crisis illustrated in this study has yet to be coupled with a proportionate willingness to act .

London received a vote of confidence from Berkeley Group this morning as the housebuilder ’ s boss said he believed the capital is set for a post-pandemic boom .\nThe Group made a profit before tax of more than half a billion pounds in its last financial year , much of which was driven by the sale of properties worth more than £700,000 , it confirmed to markets this morning .\nThe housebuilder saw profit before tax of £518.1m , up slightly from £503.7m in its last financial year .\nRevenue at the business stood at £2.2bn for the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley said it sold 2,825 homes in London and the South East at an average selling price of £770,000 , which helped to drive revenue for the year .\nChief executive Rob Perrins said : “ Today ’ s strong results reflect the consistent and focused application of Berkeley ’ s uniquely long-term business model , the quality of the homes and places we create and our proficiency in adapting to the challenges of the pandemic , sustaining production throughout.\n” The housebuilder added 10 new brownfield sites to its land holdings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,650 new homes for the future , and advanced a further 7,000 homes in its immediate pipeline .\nDespite the housing boom , the value of Berkeley ’ s private sales was 20 per cent lower than in the previous financial year .\nThe business , which last year built 10 per cent of new homes in London , said the capital would thrive again when Covid restrictions had been lifted .\n“ This is a very strong platform from which to continue serving the most under supplied housing markets in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipates and London is again able to flourish as a global destination for culture , entertainment , education , recreation and business , ” Perrins continued .\n“ London is one of the world ’ s greatest open and welcoming cities and it has been wonderful to witness its vibrancy returning over recent weeks , with the gradual lifting of restrictions .\nPeople thrive on its energy , opportunity and unparalleled attributes.\n” Berkeley Group ’ s share price fell 2.28 per cent shortly after the market open , as investors reacted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .\nAnthony Codling , CEO of property platform Twindig , said : “ In a period covering lockdowns one , two and three , Berkeley Group has grown revenue , grown profits and increased the number of homes it sold .\n“ We may have embraced working from home , but it appears that not all are leaving London and the South East in search of a rural idyll .\n“ Looking ahead , Berkeley has a very strong balance sheet , a strong order book and more than £1bn of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in Euro ’ s it would be Berkeley 1 Pandemic nil.\n” Richard Hunter , head of markets at Interactive Investor , added : “ Berkeley ’ s heavy exposure to London has been both a blessing and a curse , although the company remains convinced of recovery in the capital .\n“ The effects of the pandemic on the London market put pressure on its traditional home buyers , where there is a broadly even split of owner-occupiers and ( overseas ) investors .\nWith international travel restrictions muddying the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this core market for the group has been under pressure .\n“ Despite these developments , the London market remains one where there is strong undersupply , and Berkeley remains committed to its presence .\n“ There is a clear debate on the lasting effects of the pandemic on city life , as some buyers have chosen to move to more rural areas and as the requirements for commuting have significantly reduced .\nBy the same token , London has its own idiosyncratic attractions which the group believes remain intact .\n“ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than those seen in pre-pandemic times .\n”",

Rolls Royce was already in serious difficulty even before the pandemic wind came blowing in from China a year ago , due to problems with its Trent 1000 engine that powered the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .\nToday ’ s full year results were not any better , and did not come as a surprise for CMC Markets UK chief market analyst Michael Hewson , given the virtual grounding of civil air travel which almost delivered a final coup de grace to the business last year .\n“ At one point there was some concern as to whether this iconic British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake of the collapse in air miles as a result of the pandemic , ” Hewson said .\nRead more : Rolls-Royce plunges to huge loss as Covid turbulence sets in Still in the red This morning ’ s operating loss of £2.1bn is almost identical to 2018 ’ s results .\n“ While the size of the loss is certainly sobering , unlike last year optimism is probably in shorter supply due to the uncertainty about when air travel is likely to return to any kind of normal post pandemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating loss wasn ’ t bad enough , when other costs are added the loss balloons to an even bigger £4bn , due to the addition of other charges , Hewson pointed out , including a £1.7bn underlying finance charge related to its FX hedge book , due to lower US dollar receipts in 2020 , as well as future years .\n“ Coming into the pandemic , the company was very reliant for up to 50 per cent of its revenue on these aviation air miles , which means the company was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash outflow , even with the thousands of job cuts and cost savings , ” he noted .\nManagement has gone to great lengths to deal with this cash flow problem in order to get the business through to the other side of the pandemic .\nThe launch of a £1bn bond issue as well as a £2bn 10 for 3 rights issue at a 41 per cent discount to 130p was eventually taken up by shareholders , and along with the progress on the vaccine rollout the company has seen a decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 17-year lows we saw in September last year .\nRead more : Rolls-Royce picks former Deloitte partner Kakoullis as finance chief Not out of the woods yet The company still is not out of the woods yet , announcing that it is likely going to have shut its factories in the summer for two weeks to help stem the losses .\n“ This morning ’ s full year results only serve to reinforce the scale of the challenge facing the civil aerospace side of the business , however at least in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a little bit better than was expected , ” Hewson said .\n“ With revenues coming in at £11.76bn , [ this is ] still well below the £15.45bn we saw in 2019 , but certainly much better than had originally been feared all the way back in the late summer of last year.\n” Free cash outflow for the last tax year came in at an eye watering high £4.18bn .\nAt its last trading update , the company estimated a free cash flow outflow of £2bn for 2021 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of 55 per cent of the levels of 2019 , with an expectation of turning cash flow positive at the end of the second half of this fiscal year , with positive free cash flow of £750m in 2022 , based on engine flying hours of 80 per cent of 2019 levels , Hewson noted .\n“ This expectation hasn ’ t changed , even though it comes across as very optimistic , given that since they made that assessment air travel has remained very much in the doldrums due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place since the beginning of January , ” he added .\nAt the time this seemed a touch optimistic , Hewson continued , given that air travel is unlikely to be able to return to any semblance of normal this year , given that the government is embarking on a very slow reopening policy .\n“ This morning ’ s numbers are a sobering reminder of how much damage the pandemic has done to an iconic brand , and also illustrate how hard the long road back will be , ” he remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to take years to return to normal it will be more important than ever that Rolls Royce steps up in other areas of its business to offset the revenue hit to civil aviation over the next few years , and get greater returns there .\n“ The hope is that investors and shareholders retain the patience seen so far in terms of the rally in the share price off last year ’ s multiyear lows , ” Hewson concluded .",

When Yuval Noah Harari published his first book , `` Sapiens , '' in 2014 about the history of the human species , it became a global bestseller , and turned the little-known , Israeli history professor into one of the most popular writers and thinkers on the planet .\nBut when we met with Harari in Tel Aviv this summer , it was n't our species ' past that concerned him , it was our future .\nHarari believes we may be on the brink of creating not just a new , enhanced species of human , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is far more intelligent than we are .\nIt sounds like science fiction , but Yuval Noah Harari says it 's actually much more dangerous than that .\nAnderson Cooper : You said , `` We are one of the last generations of Homo sapiens .\nWithin a century or two , Earth will be dominated by entities that are more different from us than we are different from chimpanzees . ''\nAnderson Cooper : What the hell does that mean ?\nThat freaked me out .\nYuval Noah Harari : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-engineer our bodies and brains , whether it is with genetic engineering or by directly connecting brains to computers , or by creating completely non-organic entities , artificial intelligence which is not based at all on the organic body and the organic brain .\nAnd these technologies are developing at break-neck speed .\nAnderson Cooper : If that is true , then it creates a whole other species .\nYuval Noah Harari : This is something which is way beyond just another species .\nYuval Noah Harari is talking about the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other technologies like gene editing - that could one day enable parents to create smarter or more attractive children , and brain computer interfaces that could result in human/machine hybrids .\nAnderson Cooper : What does that do to a society ?\nIt seems like the rich will have access whereas others would n't .\nYuval Noah Harari : One of the dangers is that we will see in the coming decades a process of -- of s -- of -- greater inequality than in any previous time in history because for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real biological inequality .\nIf the new technologies are available only to the rich or only to people from a certain country then Homo sapiens will split into different biological castes because they really have different bodies and -- and different abilities .\nHarari has spent the last few years lecturing and writing about what may lie ahead for humankind .\nHarari at Davos in 2018 : In the coming generations we will learn how to engineer bodies and brains and minds .\nHe has written two books about the challenges we face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' and `` 21 Lessons for the 21st Century '' -- which along with `` Sapiens '' have sold more than 35 million copies and been translated into 65 languages .\nHis writings have been recommended by President Barack Obama , as well as tech moguls , Bill Gates , and Mark Zuckerberg .\nAnderson Cooper : You raise warnings about technology .\nYou 're also embraced by a lot of folks in Silicon Valley .\nYuval Noah Harari : They are a bit afraid of their own power .\nThat they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , over the course of evolution , really .\nAnd I think that spooks at least some of them .\nAnd that 's a good thing .\nAnd this is why they are kind of to some extent open to listening .\nAnderson Cooper : You started as a history professor .\nWhat do you call yourself now ?\nYuval Noah Harari : I 'm still a historian .\nBut I think history is the study of change , not just the study of the past .\nBut it covers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ph.D. in history at Oxford , and lives in Israel , where the past is still very present .\nHe took us to an archeological site called Tel Gezer .\nHarari says cities like this were only possible because about 70,000 years ago our species -

         "Should the minimum wage really be $26 an hour?. The federal minimum wage in the U.S. has remained glued at $ 7.25 an hour for the last 12 years , the longest stretch without a boost since it was first adopted in 1938 .\nYet there 's another revealing figure that underscores how the minimum wage — created by Congress after the Great Depression as a way to ensure that Americans were fairly paid for their labor — has failed to keep up with the times .\nEven as workers have been more industrious — helping drive corporate profits , the stock market and CEO compensation to record heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even declined when factoring in inflation .\nIf the minimum wage had kept pace with gains in the economy 's productivity over the last 50 years , it would be nearly $ 26 an hour today , or more than $ 50,000 a year in annual income , one economist notes .\n`` That may sound pretty crazy , but that 's roughly what the minimum wage would be today if it had kept pace with productivity growth since its value peaked in 1968 , '' wrote Dean Baker , senior economist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research , in a recent blog post .\nProductivity — how much income someone generates in an hour of work — is critical for the economy because it helps determine a country 's standard of living .\nYet rising productivity is no guarantee of a healthy economy .\nEqually important is how the fruits of productivity are divided .\nTo that end , `` Having the minimum wage track productivity growth is not a crazy idea , '' Baker said .\nA recent CBS News poll found that most Americans support a hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that cut across socioeconomic status .\nNationwide , nearly 250,000 workers earn $ 7.25 per hour , while roughly 865,000 earn less than that , labor data show .\nTo be sure , dozens of states and cities have boosted their baseline wages over the past few years , especially in areas with a high cost of living such as California , where the minimum wage is now $ 14 an hour for employers with at least 26 workers .\nYet the federal minimum wage remains in effect in 20 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker 's analysis comes at an uneasy time for millions of workers across the U.S. , even as they celebrate Labor Day .\nThe COVID-19 Delta variant means many white-collar workers wo n't return to the office until 2022 , while many lower wage workers continue to cope with the risk of getting infected , not to mention confrontations with anti-mask or anti-vaccine customers .\nInequality also widened during the pandemic , with the wealth of the richest Americans surging as stocks soared , while those at the bottom were more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also more likely to work in jobs where they faced a great chance of catching COVID-19 .\n`` Dean makes an important point .\nWhether or not you should argue it should be $ 26 , it is a very strong point illustrating what has been happening with our economy , '' said Ken Jacobs , the chair of the University of California , Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education .\nSince the 1970s , `` We have seen that complete divorce between wages and productivity and massively increased inequality with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ''\nA $ 26 an hour minimum wage might strike some as unrealistic , with Baker noting that his analysis is more of a `` thought experiment '' than a practical proposition .\nFor one , more than tripling the federal baseline wage would result in a host of undesirable economic effects , from a spike in unemployment ( as employers would need to cut jobs in order to pay the workers they could afford to keep on ) to higher inflation .\n`` The problem is that we have made many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of income upward , so that we can not support a pay structure that gives workers at the bottom $ 52,000 a year , '' Baker wrote .\nSo what happened in the 1970s that decoupled the minimum wage from productivity gains ?\nThe weakening of unions over the past several decades is believed to be one cause , eroding the ability of workers to collectively bargain and win wage gains and other concessions .\nOrganized labor is now at its lowest membership levels in the modern era , with only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union in 2019 , down from 2 in 10 in 1983 .\nAt the same time , wage gains have increasingly gone to college-educated workers , a trend that accelerated after the Great Recession , as employers outsourced or automated jobs , reducing their need for modestly paid workers .\nThe current administration is aiming to shore up unions , with President Joe Biden vowing to be `` the strongest labor president you have ever had . ''\nDemocratic lawmakers have supported the Protecting the Right to Organize ( PRO ) Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize and bargain collectively .\nLabor Day was created by the labor movement more than a century ago to celebrate the American worker .\nBut the past year has n't been a happy one for many of the nation 's 161 million workers .\nFor one , 9.1 million workers are losing pandemic unemployment benefits on the holiday as the aid expires .\nThere 's not much recourse for those who are still struggling with unemployment , with the Biden administration saying it wo n't extend the federal jobless programs .\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading across the nation , there are signs of economic headwinds , notably a sharp slowdown in hiring .\nThat effectively creates a Catch-22 , according to Daniel Kuehn , a research associate at the Urban Institute .\nAlthough businesses and institutions like schools must reopen — and stay open — for the labor market to continue healing from the impact of COVID-19 , the Delta variant 's rapid spread argues in favor of shutting down to safeguard public health .\nAlready , more than 3 million workers say they 're sitting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching or spreading the virus .\nThe loss of pandemic jobless benefits `` is going to be a disaster , and it 's an ironic disaster to happen on Labor Day , '' Kuehn said .\n`` What gets people back to work is businesses and society opening back up and having income to spend . ''\nMeanwhile , the workforce is still below its pre-pandemic size , with the labor force reaching a historic peak of more than 164 million workers in February 2020 , just before the crisis shut down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many others remain unemployed , and some parents with children continue to sit out of the labor market due to remote school and health concerns .\nThat 's led to a hiring crunch for some employers , especially for restaurants , bars , retailers and other mostly low-wage businesses that involve dealing with the public .\nSome employers have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits for keeping workers on the sidelines , but economists do n't see any evidence yet to support that .\nIn states that cut off those benefits in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth than in states that maintained the aid .\nThe difficulty in finding workers has helped lift wages for low-paid employees , although higher wages might not be enough to convince some people to come off the sidelines , Jacobs said .\n`` The fact that we saw some wage increases at the bottom and the middle in recent months is a positive sign for workers , but it does n't represent a long-run shift in the power balance in the workplace . ''\n`` We do n't have a labor shortage — @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' he added .\n`` Too many [ employers ] are offering too little to make it viable for them to take those jobs . ''",

         "Mother continues daughter’s art after losing her to Beirut blast. A young woman ’ s artistic dreams cut short by the 2020 Lebanon explosion is being carried further by her mother .\nBeirut , Lebanon – In early 2020 , Lebanese-Armenian designer Gaia Fodoulian was busy planning the launch of her new virtual gallery .\nThe 29-year-old sought to support the region ’ s artists and designers with a further-reaching , modern platform .\nOn August 4 , 2020 , her dreams were cut short by the massive explosion that rocked Beirut , devastating entire neighbourhoods , and destroying countless lives .\nFodoulian was one of the 208 people killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after she passed away , her mother , Annie Vartivarian , decided to complete her daughter ’ s work in her memory .\nEarlier this month , the virtual platform Art Design Lebanon ( AD Leb ) launched “ Everyone is the creator of one ’ s own faith ” , a physical pop-up exhibition at the blast-damaged historic Tabbal Building .\n“ Gaia had started this project and I wanted her name , her legacy to live on , even if she is no longer with us , ” Vartivarian told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she would have wanted me to do and I believe in what she was doing .\n“ I always trusted her instincts and would ask her , ‘ What do you think about this ?\n’ I still ask her sometimes , but of course , she doesn ’ t answer now , ” she added .\n“ A platform like AD Leb is needed in Lebanon and the region .\nI have faith in this venture that she had embarked on and wanted it to be realised.\n” All profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gaia Fodoulian Foundation , an organisation founded to support and care for animals in need and provides assistance for animal rescuers – a cause that Fodoulian cared deeply about .\nFodoulian had set aside some funds to produce her own design pieces – a pair of modular benches that could be made from concrete or wood , which she designed as a graduate student at Milan ’ s Istituto Marangoni .\nVartivarian took the designs and had the benches produced for AD Leb ’ s inaugural exhibition .\nGaïa Fodoulian ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one before she died in the blast [ Maghie Ghali/Al Jazeera ] The exhibition ’ s title comes from the photo caption of Fodoulian ’ s last social media post – a carefree snap of her running towards the camera on a trip to Sri Lanka .\nVartivarian said she made the post in a brief 15-minute lull in their busy afternoon , just a few hours before the blast .\n“ Even though she had a strong personality she was also very sensitive , which is what made her look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s why she posted that post at the last minute , that she knew her soul was leaving the world behind , ” Vartivarian said .\n“ I was so intrigued to know what was in her mind when she made that post .\nI thought about that caption a lot … So I proposed it to the artists in the show , kind of like Gaia ’ s last instruction to me maybe .\n“ I can ’ t say for sure what she had envisioned but if I start doubting everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added .\n“ She always used to ask me for my opinion on her designs and work , so I ’ m treating it like that now.\n” The pop-up show brings together both newly commissioned and existing works by artists and designers Samer Bou Rjeily , Karen Chekerdjian , Hatem Imam , Sirine Fattouh , Paul Kaloustian , Nathalie Khayat , Hussein Nassereddine and Caroline Tabet .\nKhayat ’ s work “ Light Sleepers ” is directly linked to last year ’ s tragedy , with an installation of 208 porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the blast .\nEach Raku-fired piece is unique , created with abstract shapes and moulded on impulse , glazed in a variety of colours .\n“ I made them in a very short period of time , so it was very intense work .\nI like that they have their own individuality and each carry their own story , ” Khayat told Al Jazeera .\n“ I like to work with the idea of rituals .\nFor me , lighting a candle is a ritual by itself .\nIt ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different occasions , it carries a different meaning behind it .\nIn this context , it ’ s a tribute for the people who lost their lives on August 4.\n” Other projects take a broader approach to the theme of faith and belief , such as Nassereddine ’ s sculptural installation “ The Red Castle , As It Occurred ” , inspired by a poem by the famous Abbasid poet Abu al-Mutanabbi .\nHe presents a tall limestone column , the material probably used to build the castle originally , tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era formula .\nThe piece draws attention to how something small led to an incorrect belief for centuries , simply because it was written down somewhere .\n“ He was describing a battle happening around this red castle , and for centuries it was believed so , because there are no remains of this castle now , all that remains is this poem , ” Nassereddine said .\n“ It was believed the castle was built from brick or red stone , but more archaeological research showed that there were no structures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red materials and it was only the poet ’ s imagination.\n” Each work is given its own room , spread across the first two floors of the spacious heritage building , with scenography designed by Ghaith & Jad .\nVartivarian wanted something with more history than the usual white-walled galleries or industrial warehouses often used .\nBuilt in the late 19th century and expanded during the French Mandate era , the building bears the characteristic lavishly decorated vaulted ceilings , triple arcade window , and geometric-tiled floors of many Lebanese heritages home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 800 heritage buildings that suffered damage during the blast , as most of Beirut ’ s Ottoman architecture lies close to the port .\n“ It just so happened that the owner of the building had passed away during the blast and also the building has been affected , ” she said .\n“ I felt something in this building , its character and that there was a connection between the building and the exhibition.\n” AD Leb hopes its use of the space will attract interest and result in proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has partnered with NGO Silat for Culture to organise free tours of the exhibition and the building ’ s history .\nAD Leb also has plans for a 3D video of the exhibition to reach outside audiences and an online programme of talks and on-site performances .\nIt hopes to schedule four exhibitions a year , featuring regional artists and collaborations with international practitioners and institutions .\nVartivarian aims for the platform to offer some hope to the Lebanese cultural community , which has taken a serious hit during the COVID-19 pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fallout from the blast .\nThe badly affected areas of Gemmayzeh and Mar Mikhael are home to most of the city ’ s galleries and cultural instructions .\nVartivarian ’ s own Letitia Gallery in Hamra shuttered for good following the blast .\n“ To accept the situation in Lebanon for what it is – hopeless at best – is to accept defeat , to fall into despair .\nIn order to carry on , day in and day out , I have to believe that eventually things will get better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hard to muster the energy , or even the courage , to emotionally invest … but it has been my duty to encourage everyone I worked with on this exhibition to fight this feeling and to not to give in to despair .\n”",

         "What Deb Haaland's historic confirmation means to Native Americans. On Monday evening , Debra Haaland , a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblo of Laguna , became the first Native American ever to be confirmed as a Cabinet secretary .\nWhen she testified in February at her confirmation hearing , Haaland began her opening remarks by introducing herself to senators in her tribal language of Keresan .\n`` This historic nature of my confirmation is not lost on me , but I will say it 's not about me .\nRather , I hope this nomination would be an inspiration for Americans moving forward together as one nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Haaland said .\nShe grew up in a military family and later became a single mother who struggled to stay above the poverty line .\nHaaland eventually earned a bachelor 's degree in English from the University of New Mexico when she was 34 .\nTwelve years later she earned her J.D .\nin Indian law from University of New Mexico School of Law .\nBefore she was elected to Congress in 2018 , Haaland served as the tribal administrator for the San Felipe Pueblo for almost two years and then chaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same year , she and Kansas ' Sharice Davids became the first Native American women to serve in Congress .\nShe made history again when President Biden nominated her to lead the Interior Department .\n`` If an Indigenous woman from humble beginnings can be confirmed as secretary of the Interior , our country holds promise for everyone , '' Haaland said .\nThat feeling of promise is shared by other Indigenous people who spoke with CBS News about the significance of Haaland 's confirmation .\n`` I just think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to visibly see someone who looks like him , someone who comes from his same community , who is at that level , '' said Valerie Siow , an educator and Laguna Pueblo Native .\n`` Sometimes I ca n't even believe it . ''\n`` Never in my wildest dreams '' did Siow think she 'd one day witness a Cabinet secretary speaking her language .\nHer 9-year-old son attends a Native American charter school in Albuquerque , where he is learning the Laguna Keres dialect .\nThe introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siow is teaching her son , a practice meant to pay respect to one 's ancestors .\n`` That 's who you are , '' she told her son .\n`` You represent yourself to people in that way .

''\nAlong with the acreage itself come concerns about stewardship , about air , land and water quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pueblo once housed one of the world 's largest open uranium mines .\nIt employed much of the reservation 's population , moving Native Americans away from traditional farming and ranching jobs while stimulating the Pueblo economy .\nBut the mine exacted a terrible cost : it polluted reservation waters and lands , rendering areas unviable , and destroyed the health of those who worked there .\nHaaland 's background endows her with a certain `` empathy '' on the job , especially as it relates to conservation and combating the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land and we are part of the whole ecosystem in that we have a relationship and also responsibility to the ecosystem such that it sustains us , it gives us life .\nBut also if we violate those responsibilities , then there are consequences , '' he said .\nHaaland spoke to that philosophy during her confirmation hearing , recounting the first word Navajo Code Talkers transmitted to one another : Ne-he-mah , meaning `` our mother , '' the word they used to mean America .\n`` This is all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYou 've heard the earth referred to [ as ] 'Mother Earth .

         "Joe Biden's big betrayal of a key promise comes at a terrible time. After a steady increase in pressure from outside groups and questions from the media , the Biden administration officially decided on Friday to break its pledge to lift President Donald Trump 's strict limits on refugee admissions for the fiscal year ending in September .\nDespite previously pledging to raise the cap on refugees from the extremely low level of 15,000 to 62,500 , Biden has reversed himself .\nDuring the presidential campaign , Biden pledged to raise the cap to 125,000 in the next fiscal year , and as recently as February , Secretary of State Tony Blinken had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this fiscal year would be increased more than fourfold .\nMany observers had become increasingly worried about Biden 's commitment to following through on this objective as the weeks dragged on without official action .\nSome reports indicated Biden was worried about the `` optics '' of raising the refugee cap .\nCNN 's Kaitlan Collins on April 8 pressed White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the issue given the delay , and Psaki insisted Biden was committed to the increase : But on Friday , the fears of refugee advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden is a cowardly betrayal of his many supporters who were horrified by Trump 's aggression toward and disregard for asylum seekers and refugees .\nPrior to the revelation of Biden 's reversal , The Atlantic writer Adam Serwer said on Twitter : `` Biden 's delay in reversing Trump 's discriminatory refugee restrictions is a violation of his campaign promises and the reasons he gave for running in the first place . ''\nIn a new piece , he wrote : So far , Biden has done a lot that is popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Rescue Plan , proposing a big infrastructure and spending package .\nAnd he may fear that increasing the refugee cap is unpopular and will derail the momentum that he has .\nIndeed , one Morning Consult poll found that increasing refugee admissions was the only major Biden priority that was unpopular .\nBut one reason for passing popular policies that meet people 's needs is to have more cover and trust with the public when taking values-based policy steps that might trigger some discontent .\nAnd it 's not as if raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — he campaigned on letting in more refugees , so he should n't feel the need to shy away from it now .\nIt is one of the easiest ways for a president to drastically improve a large number of human lives , saving families from dire conditions in refugee camps , with little or no downside .\nAnd there 's likely no upside at all to breaking this promise .\nThe anti-immigrant right wing will not give Biden any credit at all for backing down ; instead , it will likely just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further .\nThey 'll cite Biden 's capitulation on this promise as evidence that refugees really are a problem , and perhaps say that letting in any refugees is a problem .\nThis is a particularly terrible time for Biden to be retreating on the immigration issue , too , because anti-immigrant bigotry is resurgent .\nFox News 's Tucker Carlson , an influential leader in conservatism , is openly endorsing the white supremacist `` replacement theory , '' which Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson recently echoed .\nAnd on Friday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new , openly nativist caucus based on `` Anglo Saxon political traditions . ''\nMaybe this increasing sentiment on the right , combined with manufactured right-wing outrage about the border , has spooked Biden into capitulating on this issue .\nBut appeasing this bigotry wo n't work .\nIt will only embolden it .",

When President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20 , he will inherit a long list of problems — from a deadly pandemic to a painful recession to domestic terrorism by white nationalist groups .\nRegardless , many GOP partisans obviously have no desire to help Biden 's incoming administration , and journalist Dana Milbank cites Russell Vought as one of the worst partisans in a Washington Post column published on New Year 's Eve .\n`` If , in the new year , pandemic vaccines are n't available as promised , Americans ca n't return to work because economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully attacks the United States because national security agencies could n't pay for new defenses , a hefty share of the blame should be placed on a man you 've probably never heard of : one Russell Thurlow Vought , '' Milbank writes .\nVought has been serving as director of the Office and Management and Budget since July ; before that , he was OMB deputy director .\nAnd according to Milbank , one of Vought 's main goals is making things as difficult as possible for Biden 's administration — which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` What Russ Vought is very good at is sabotage , '' Milbank explains .\n`` He 's sabotaging national security , the pandemic response and the economic recovery — all to make things more difficult for the incoming Biden administration .\nThat he 's also sabotaging the country seems not to matter to Vought , who has spent nearly two decades as a right-wing bomb thrower . ''\nMilbank continues , `` He has blocked civil servants at OMB from cooperating with the Biden transition , denying President-elect Joe Biden the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents-elect , including Barack Obama and Trump himself .\nTransition figures warn that it will likely delay and hamper economic and pandemic relief and national security preparation . ''\nThe Post columnist notes that Vought has angrily accused Biden 's transition team of making `` false statements '' about the Trump OMB , denying that he has been uncooperative — only to confirm his lack of cooperation with this statement : `` What we have not done and will not do is use current OMB staff to write the ( Biden transition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration 's work… .\nRedirecting staff and resources to draft your team 's budget proposals is not an OMB transition responsibility .\nOur system of government has one president and one administration at a time . ''\nMilbank notes how much of an extremist Vought is .\nIn an anti-Islam article published on January 17 , 2016 , Vought wrote , `` Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology .\nThey do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ , his son , and they stand condemned . ''\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for RedState , Vought slammed an infrastructure bill as `` communism . ''\n`` Now , Vought is intentionally botching the transition , without regard for the dire consequences Americans could suffer , '' Milbank warns .\n`` This is what happens when you put an arsonist in charge of the fire department .

Prosecutors on Sunday said a teenager charged in the fatal shooting of a 7-year-old girl at a McDonald ’ s drive-thru was allegedly found with guns tied to the attack after he was shot during a police chase last week on the Eisenhower Expressway — but he was n't one of the gunmen .\nMarion Lewis , 18 , of East Garfield Park , faces counts of first-degree murder , attempted murder and a litany of other felony charges stemming from the killing of young Jaslyn Adams earlier this month and Thursday ’ s rush-hour pursuit .\nHe was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile Lewis wasn ’ t named as one of the alleged gunmen in Jaslyn ’ s shooting , Assistant State ’ s Attorney Kevin DeBoni linked him to the vehicle used in the her killing .\nDeBoni noted that Lewis was identified with the help of Jaslyn ’ s father , 28-year-old Jontae Adams , who was wounded in the April 18 shooting .\nThat afternoon , a silver Audi pulled into the parking lot of a McDonald ’ s , 3200 W. Roosevelt , and stopped behind Adams ’ tan Infiniti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when two individuals wearing hoods got out of the Audi and began firing into the car carrying Jaslyn , with one of them using a Draco , AK-47-style assault weapon with a “ banana clip , ” according to DeBoni .\nAfter both shooters hopped back into the Audi , Adams attempted to drive forward , prompting the suspects to get out of the car again and open fire .\nForty-five shell casings were recovered at the scene — 28 from the assault rifle and 17 more from a 40-caliber handgun , DeBoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance footage , according to DeBoni , who said Lewis was n't seen getting out of the Audi .\nHowever , Lewis allegedly posted a video to social media earlier that day that showed him driving a vehicle with interior details matching the Audi .\nDeBoni said he was traveling with two individuals whose hooded sweatshirts matched those of the shooters , one of whom was seen with the Draco assault rifle allegedly used in the shooting .\nJaslyn and her father were both struck by the gunfire and taken to Stroger Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead and Adams was treated for a gunshot wound to the torso .\nAdams identified Lewis and another suspect as members of the same gang based on the social media post , which was discovered after he told investigators that Lewis previously threatened him online .\nPolice have said the attack that killed Jaslyn was gang-related and was believed to be tied to another shooting later that day that wounded two people at a Popeyes in Humboldt Park .\nAll three suspects in the video were identified as associates by a detective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an apartment in Lombard using a Facebook account , said DeBoni .\nOfficers on Thursday set up surveillance at the apartment complex , where they noticed the Audi and saw Lewis leave with a backpack and get into a stolen Dodge Durango .\nWhen cops in two “ covert ” vehicles attempted to box in the Durango , Lewis repeatedly hit a parked car until he was able to get free , DeBoni said .\nLewis ultimately smashed into another police vehicle and led officers on a chase through the suburbs .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lost control somewhere between Mannheim Road and 25th Avenue and crashed into a concrete barrier on the shoulder , DeBoni said .\nStill carrying the backpack , Lewis crossed multiple lanes of traffic and approached a silver Land Rover carrying five people , including children .\nLewis flashed a 40-caliber handgun and ordered the occupants out before banging on the driver ’ s window , DeBoni said .\nLewis then fired a shot at the window , causing it to shatter .\nNo one was struck , but DeBoni said the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passenger in the back was “ unable to exit with her children in the car seats on either side of her.\n” An officer who heard the shot saw Lewis pull the driver out of the SUV , DeBoni said .\nWhile ordering Lewis to raise his hands , the officer noticed the handgun underneath his thigh as he sat in the SUV .\nAs Lewis refused to comply with the officers ’ orders and made motions toward the gun , the Land Rover began rolling backward .\nIn the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five shots and struck Lewis in his left shoulder , DeBoni said .\nThe handgun was recovered with a bullet in the chamber and 18 more in an extended magazine , DeBoni said .\nThe Draco was found in Lewis ’ backpack with 18 live cartridges .\nDeBoni said the rounds collected at the scene of Jaslyn ’ s killing matched the guns .\nLewis has a lengthy juvenile record , including two pending cases in which he faces charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle , criminal damage to property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Steve Greenberg , said his client lives with his grandmother and suffers from mental health issues while urging Judge David Navarro to grant him bail .\nIn turn , Navarro denied Lewis bail .\nHis next court date was set for Thursday .",

         "Access, travel rules influence missionary vaccine policies. The International Mission Board is requiring its missionaries get the COVID-19 vaccine COVID-19 vaccine refusal rates may be high among white evangelical Christians , but the International Mission Board — which deploys thousands of missionaries — is not hesitant about the shot .\nThe global agency of the Southern Baptist Convention , the largest evangelical Protestant denomination in the U.S. , announced this month it is requiring vaccinations for missionaries they 're sending into the field amid the pandemic .\nThe IMB may be the first U.S. missionary agency known to have such a mandate , according to leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach the issue in a variety of ways including limiting where people can serve and making considerations for uneven global access to the vaccines .\n“ This is a very common-sense decision , ” said Ed Stetzer , a Southern Baptist who is dean of Mission , Ministry and Leadership at Wheaton College .\n“ Mission-sending agencies from the United States have the real opportunity to be vaccinated , and they ’ re going to places around the world that don ’ t. ” The IMB policy applies to both current and future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmong the reasons it cited for the measure are health concerns and the fact that increasing numbers of countries are implementing their own vaccine requirements — some field personnel have reported needing to show proof to board airplanes and subways or enter restaurants and malls .\nIn a statement announcing the policy , IMB leaders acknowledged that it could be a deal-breaker for some people considering missionary work or currently serving with the organization .\nThe Rev .\nAllen Nelson IV , a pastor who leads a Southern Baptist congregation in Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is completely opposed to mandates for missionaries .\n“ This is something that must be left up to a person ’ s own conscience , research and discussions with a doctor , as well as their particular ministry context , ” Nelson told The Associated Press .\nAmong religious groups that have stopped short of issuing vaccine mandates is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , widely known as the Mormon church , which is giving unvaccinated missionaries assignments in their home countries .\nThe United Methodist Church , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get vaccinated but does not require it .\nThat is partly because availability is not consistent around the world , according to Judy Chung , executive director of missionary services for the denomination ’ s Global Ministries .\n“ We have discussed how to promote vaccination without making a mandatory requirement , '' Chung said , `` because some may not have access to that yet.\n” The denomination currently has about 240 full-time missionaries serving in 70 countries , and the most recently deployed cohort of about 40 has a vaccination rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that our missionary population are safe so that they can focus on the mission work that has been assigned to them , ” Chung said .\n“ We want to make sure that we are not causing harm as we engage in mission.\n” A key question for U.S.-based mission groups is whether they will fall under the Biden administration 's recently announced rule that companies with more than 100 employees must require workers be vaccinated for the coronavirus or undergo weekly testing .\nIf they do , Ted Esler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an association that includes hundreds of missionary agencies in the U.S. and Canada , said about 30 % of those agencies could be affected .\nHe thinks they would comply with the federal mandate but said the issue is not currently stirring much discussion .\nUltimately , he noted , organizations ' internal rules may be rendered moot by vaccine entry requirements that many countries have instituted for visitors .\n“ Whether you have a policy or not , '' Esler said , `` if you ’ re going to serve cross-culturally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be faced with the government regulation.\n” A June survey by the Public Religion Research Institute showed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreasing and acceptance growing , but refusal rates holding steady .\nIt also found significant variance of opinion between people from different faith traditions .\nWhite evangelical Protestants had the highest vaccine refusal rate at 24 % and among the lowest acceptance rates at 56 % .\nBy comparison , acceptance rates stood at 56 % for Hispanic Protestants , 65 % for Latter-day Saints , 66 % for Black Protestants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 74 % for white mainline Protestants .\nThe IMB has had vaccine requirements for other diseases in place since the 1980s , and it says some have chosen to skip international service because of it .\nEsler , who served as a missionary in Bosnia in the 1990s with the Pioneers organization , said he had to be inoculated against diseases like diphtheria , polio , tetanus and typhoid before he could go .\nEsler wasn ’ t eager to get a COVID-19 vaccine and is hesitant to advise others to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated because he is continuing to travel .\n“ From my perspective , this is an issue more because of the fact that it ’ s COVID-related than it is vaccine-related , ” Esler said .\n“ It ’ s unfortunate that the COVID vaccine here is controversial and rejected by some , '' he added , `` when in other places it would be coveted and highly sought-after and they can not get it.\n” ——— Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through The Conversation U.S .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .",

Ron Johnson held a news conference with families who shared stories about the injuries they ’ d suffered as a result of taking the COVID jab .\nYou can watch the hour-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed , above .\nWhile Johnson is diplomatic , stating that most people have no problem after taking the jab , and that the shots have saved many lives , it seems clear that side effects from the COVID injections are FAR more common than anyone is willing to publicly admit .\nCase in point : September 10 , 2021 , WXYZ-TV Channel 7 posted a request on Facebook,1,2 asking people who had lost an unvaccinated loved one to COVID-19 to contact them for a story .\nAs of September 29 , 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments , and the vast majority are about someone who was injured or died from the COVID shot , or who got severe COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated .\nYou can browse through the hundreds of thousands of comments here .\nBelow are some examples of the comments posted on the site : These responses are what you would call a major CLUE .\nAs noted by one commenter , “ Doesn ’ t sound like you ’ re getting the story you need judging by the vast majority of these comments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is such an overwhelming outpouring of vaccine reactions maybe do a story on that ?\nThere ’ s lots of people here to pool from it seems.\n” We now also have medical insiders blowing the whistle , confirming COVID jab injuries are incredibly commonplace , and most are never reported .\nIn an upcoming article , I will share businessman Steve Kirsch ’ s analysis that strongly suggests the reports in the U.S .\nVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) is underreported by a factor of 41 .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 deaths and up to 5 million COVID jab injuries .\nIn a stunning Project Veritas report , Jodi O ’ Malley , a nurse working for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , reveals health officials are ignoring and covering up COVID-19 vaccine injuries .\nO ’ Malley says she ’ s seen “ dozens of people come in with adverse reactions , ” including myocarditis , congestive heart failure and deaths , yet the reactions are not being reported .\nThis , despite the fact that both the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require any suspected injury from an emergency use vaccine to be reported .\nOne of the reasons O ’ Malley decided to come forward , knowing she will likely lose her job over it , is because one of her coworkers who was coerced into taking the shot died .\n“ Nobody should have to decide between their livelihood or take the vaccine , ” O ’ Malley says .\nShe also points out that while there are medications such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus , the HHS will terminate anyone who uses these drugs .\nWere these drugs permitted , the COVID jab wouldn ’ t even qualify for emergency use .\nWhen O ’ Malley asks Gayle Lundberg , a DHHS pharmacist , if ivermectin can be given to a patient if the doctor is willing to prescribe it , Lundberg responds : “ This is evil at the highest level , ” O ’ Malley says .\n“ You have the FDA , the CDC , that are both supposed to be protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and everything we ’ ve done so far is unscientific.\n” Another whistleblower , Deborah Conrad , was recently featured in a Highwire exclusive .\nConrad , a physician ’ s assistant , reveals there ’ s a complete disregard for the requirement to report COVID jab injuries at her hospital too .\nI will publish that interview this coming Friday , October 8 , 2021 .\nIn Part 3 of its COVID vaccine investigative series , Project Veritas exposes the true sentiments of two Johnson & Johnson officials : Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business lead , and Justin Durrant , a Johnson & Johnson scientist .\nSpeaking to an undercover Project Veritas reporter over a meal , Schadt admits he does not agree with the push to vaccinate children .\n“ Kids shouldn ’ t get a f*cking [ COVID ] vaccine , ” he says .\n“ It ’ s terrible … It ’ s a kid , you just don ’ t do that , you know ?\nNot something that ’ s so unknown in terms of repercussions down the road.\n” When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the long-term repercussions are , he replies , “ I mean , how could you ?\nRight ?\nThere ’ s nobody who ’ s 30 years in who said , ‘ Hey , I had the vaccine and I don ’ t have a third eyeball.\n” When asked if we can trust the media when it comes to reporting on the COVID shots , Schadt states , “ In no capacity should we ever trust anything that they say.\n” Durrant also doesn ’ t think babies and young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn ’ t make that much of a difference ” if children are unvaccinated for COVID .\nThat said , he does seem to be onboard with the corporate policy to push the injection on adults , regardless of need or personal beliefs .\nHe admits that what they ’ re doing is making life so inconvenient for the unvaccinated that they just give up and get it .\nDespite that , Durrant tells the undercover reporter : “ Don ’ t get the Johnson & Johnson [ COVID vaccine ] .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] though.\n” In late April 2021 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added a warning label to the Janssen COVID shot about the risk for potentially serious blood clotting in the brain and other sites , including the abdomen and legs , in combination with thrombocytopenia ( low platelet count ) , particularly among women.3,4 In mid-July , Guillain-Barre syndrome and altered immunocompetence were added to the list of warnings.5,6 In

the Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi , according to whom “ whoever gets vaccinated lives , whoever does not get the vaccine dies.\n” The side effects of the gene serum , cleverly disguised or deliberately not registered by the national health authorities , seem to confirm the danger of taking the vaccine and the disturbing unknowns for the health of citizens which we will soon have to face .\nThe art of medicine – which is not science , but the application of scientific principles to different cases each time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have renounced its prudence , in the name of an emergency that has risen to the level of priesthood of a religion – the religion of science , in fact – which in order to be such has cloaked itself in a dogmatism bordering on superstition .\nThe ministers of this cult have constituted themselves as a caste of untouchables , exempt from any criticism even when their claims are denied by the evidence of the facts .\nThe principles of medicine , considered universally valid until February 2020 , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of being advised to vaccinate at the height of the pandemic , the obligation of masks being imposed although they are useless , the arbitrary mandating of bizarre distances , the prohibition of treatments with effective drugs and the imposition of experimental gene therapies in violation of normal safety protocols .\nAnd just as there are new Covid priests , so there are also new heretics , that is , those who reject the new pandemic religion and want to remain faithful to the Hippocratic Oath .\nNot infrequently , the aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less titled scientists does not seem to be questioned due to their conflicts of interest or by the substantial financial benefits received by pharmaceutical companies , which under normal conditions would be scandalous and criminal .\nWhat many fail to understand is the inconsistency between the stated aims and the means that are adopted in a constantly changing manner in order to achieve them .\nIf in Sweden the absence of lockdowns and masks did not lead to higher infection rates than those in countries where people have been confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks put on even in primary schools , this element is not considered as proof of ineffectiveness of the measures .\nIf in Israel or in Great Britain mass vaccination has increased infections and made them more virulent , their example does not induce the rulers of other countries to be cautious in the vaccination campaign , but rather pushes them to evaluate the mandatory nature of their giving of the vaccine .\nIf ivermectin or hyperimmune plasma prove to be valid treatments , this is not enough to authorize them , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder the reason for this disconcerting irrationality end up refraining from judgment , giving a sort of fideistic acceptance to the pronouncements of the Covid priests , or conversely considering doctors as unreliable sorcerers .\nAs I said earlier , we are faced with a colossal deception , based on lies and fraud .\nThis deception starts from the premise that the justifications put forward by the authorities in support of their actions are sincere .\nMore simply , the mistake consists in believing that the rulers are honest and in assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we persist in finding more or less plausible justifications , with the sole purpose of not recognizing that we are the object of a conspiracy planned to the smallest detail .\nAnd while we try to rationally explain irrational behavior , while we attribute logic to the illogical actions of those who govern us , cognitive dissonance leads us to close our eyes to reality and to believe the most shameless lies .\nOnce it is understood that the present events have been intended in order to obtain certain results – and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a minority part of humanity , with incalculable harm for the majority – we must also have the honesty to recognize the criminal mens [ mind ] of the authors of this plan .\nThis criminal design also makes us understand the fraud perpetrated by civil authority in presenting certain measures as an unavoidable response to unpredictable events , when the events have been artfully created and magnified with the sole purpose of legitimizing a revolution – which Schwab identifies as the fourth industrial revolution – intended by the elite to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority is on the other hand the result of a process that began even earlier , with the French Revolution , and which made the political class the servant not of God ( whose Lordship it disdainfully disregards ) nor of the sovereign people ( which it despises and uses only to legitimize itself ) , but of the economic and financial potentates , of the international oligarchy of bankers and usurers , of multinationals and pharmaceutical companies .\nIn reality , on closer inspection , all these subjects belong to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEqual enslavement is also evident in the media : journalists have accepted – without any scruple of conscience – prostituting themselves to the powerful , going so far as to censor the truth and spread shameless lies without even trying to give them the appearance of credibility .\nUp until last year journalists counted the numbers of the “ victims ” of Covid by presenting anyone who tested positive as terminally ill ; today those who die after being vaccinated are always and only taken by a vague “ illness , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they officially decide that there is no correlation between a person ’ s death and the administration of the gene serum .\nThey twist the truth with impunity when it does not confirm their narrative , bending it to fit their purposes .\nWhat has been happening for a year and a half had been widely announced , down to the smallest detail , by the creators of the Great Reset themselves ; just as we were told the measures that would be adopted .\nOn February 17 , 1950 , testifying before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker James Warburg said , “ We will have a world government , whether you like it or not .\nThe only question that arises is whether this world government will be established by consensus or by force.\n” Four years later , the Bilderberg Group was born , which has counted among its members characters such as [ Italian bu",

         "‘Radicalisation’ and the assumption of Muslim manipulability. In an insightful piece for Harper ’ s Magazine , Joseph Bernstein , a senior reporter at BuzzFeed News , questions the idea that disinformation spread on social media platforms in the last five years , rather than long-term societal conditions , is responsible for the crisis of faith in democratic institutions that has swept the West in the age of Brexit and Donald Trump .\nFor example , he argues that “ the mosaic of experiences that form the American attitude towards the expertise of public-health authorities ” is a better explanation for vaccine and mask hesitancy , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why have we been so eager to accept Silicon Valley ’ s story about how easy we are to manipulate ?\n” he asks .\nBernstein traces the presumed power of social media companies to dubious mid-century academic studies , citing sociologist Jacques Ellul who in the 60s wrote that such studies tended to “ regard the buyer as victim and prey ” .\nHowever , conspicuously missing , especially as the anniversary of 9/11 approaches , is the tale of how this view has been supercharged by America ’ s 20-year Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real sense , this is chickens coming home to roost .\nThe idea of “ radicalisation ” , “ counter-radicalisation ” and “ de-radicalisation ” is built on a similar assumption of the manipulability of Muslim societies and people .\nRather than consider that there could be specific grievances underlying the resort of a minority to terrorist violence , the US and the West preferred to blame it on “ radical ” preachers spreading anti-Western propaganda – the Facebook of the Middle East , one might say .\nFaced with a rejection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at worst , honest though tragic innocence , broadcast by mainstream media , governments and academics in Europe and North America found comfort in portraying Muslim populations as simple-minded and easily entrapped by the spells cast by angry , bearded clerics in flowing robes .\nThis is the same view Bernstein is seeing being reproduced in the West itself to understand their own non-compliant populations , a minority of whom also pose serious terrorism threats .\nGovernments with an authoritarian bent in the non-Western world have also latched onto the idea of “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their subjects over their policies .\nThe Kenyan authorities , for example , who for the last six decades have continued the colonial policies of marginalising and oppressing the country ’ s Muslim and especially ethnic Somali population , paid little more than lip service to this history – which has been extensively documented by a Truth , Justice and Reconciliation Commission which collected more than 40,000 witness statements – when confronted with discontent and terrorist attacks committed by local actors .\nEven though 90 percent of such attacks occurred after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was little acknowledgment that may have something to do with it .\nInstead , the history was flipped on its head and the invasion justified on the basis of what it inspired .\nFurther , the government , with the media in tow , took its cue from the US and blamed “ radical ” preachers for the violence , even targeting some for extrajudicial execution .\nThis is not to say that radical preachers extolling violence have no effect – they clearly can influence a small minority of their followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to disinformation on social media platforms in the West and elsewhere , their impact has been greatly exaggerated , and their audiences infantilised , by those with an incentive to do so .\nAgain citing Ellul , Bernstein argues that propaganda or incitement would not be effective without “ pre-propaganda ” – which he equates to the entire social , cultural , political , and historical context .\nOne can think of this context as the soil in which the violent ideas spread by the clerics can take root in particular individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox News or radical preachers can lead to perverse “ solutions ” that entrench problems and privilege “ acceptable ” propaganda .\nIn her excellent talk on the limits of media literacy at the 2018 SXSW EDU conference in Austin , Texas , Danah Boyd , founder of the research institute Data & Society , points out that “ fundamentally , misinformation is contextual ” meaning what constitutes propaganda depends on who is labelling it .\n“ The difference between what is deemed missionary work , education and radicalisation depends a lot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” she says .\nShe argues that the culture wars waged between “ progressives ” and “ conservatives ” in the US are actually arguments over epistemology – how you know what you claim to know – that can not be resolved through fact-checking or compromise .\nShe sees the efforts of many liberal elites to debunk the beliefs of Trump voters as “ assertions of authority over epistemology ” and the propagation of a single , acceptable truth or worldview .\nOn the global stage , where the Global War on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods used to wage them into what Samuel Huntington called “ a clash of civilisations ” , this assertion of a singular truth channelled through Western prophets that negates the experience of much of the rest of the world , has been at the root of de-radicalisation efforts .\nYet , they can have the opposite effect .\nAs Boyd puts it , “ nothing can radicalise someone more than feeling that you are being lied to.\n” The views expressed in this article are the author ’ s own and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial stance .",

Climate action advocates reiterated demands for urgent measures to rein in global heating after the World Meteorological Organization warned Thursday that there 's a 40 % chance the planet will temporarily hit 1.5°C of warming in the next five years .\nThe WMO , a United Nations agency , also said in its update that there 's a 90 % chance at least one year between 2021 and 2025 will be the hottest on the books—a record currently held by 2016 .\n`` We can change course , but the window is closing , '' tweeted climate group 350 Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible . ''\nWMO also predicted for the next five years an increased chance of more tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and a drier Southwest .\n`` In 2021 , the Arctic ( north of 60°N ) is likely to have warmed by more than twice as much as the global mean compared to the recent past , '' the agency added .\nWMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas stressed that the predictions reflect `` more than just statistics .

         "The big problems with the climate pledges that came out of COP26. After more than two weeks of negotiations during the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow , Scotland , diplomats from almost 200 nations finally agreed on two major points : ramp up the fight against climate change and help at-risk countries prepare .\nSpecifically , governments agreed to meet again next in 2022 with more robust plans to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent by 2030 , significantly reduce emissions of methane ( which has even more global warming potential than CO2 ) , and nearly double the aid to poor countries to help them mitigate the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to initiate reductions in coal-fired power and to begin slashing government subsidies on other fossil fuels , representing the first time a COP text mentioned coal and fossil fuels .\nAcknowledging the deal is imperfect , U.S. climate envoy John Kerry registered his support .\n`` You ca n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good , and this is good .\nThis is a powerful statement , '' he said .\n`` We in the United States are really excited by the fact that this raises ambition on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement represents a step forward , it has been roundly criticized by scientists , climate activists and representatives from small , poorer nations who will feel the brunt of the climate impacts much sooner than big , richer ones .\nShauna Aminath , environment minister of the Maldives , denounced the final COP26 deal as `` not in line with the urgency and scale required . ''\nThe Maldives has supported life and human civilization for millennia , but 80 percent of the archipelago of low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean is poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising sea levels caused by global warming .\n`` What looks balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time , '' Aminath said .\n`` It will be too late for the Maldives . ''\n`` COP26 has closed the gap , but it has not solved the problem , '' said Niklas Hoehne , a climate policy expert from Wageningen University in the Netherlands .\nLong before the annual climate chinwag , there was an air of futility about what has been described as our `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a livable environment for future generations .\nHow could there not be ?\nThe leaders of more than 150 countries have been trying to lower humankind 's global warming emissions since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) talks started more than a quarter-century ago .\nAnd since the first summit was held in 1995 , global emissions have , instead , skyrocketed .\nThe summit 's host , UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson—who joined activists in invoking the mantra `` keep 1.5 alive '' —was unimpressed with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( held in Rome in the days leading up to COP26 ) that all the world leaders ' pledges without action were `` starting to sound hollow '' and criticizing their weak commitments as `` drops in a rapidly warming ocean . ''\nScience has put a deadline on us .\nIn order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels—a limit decided by the Paris agreement—humankind must achieve `` net-zero '' emissions ( i.e.\n, whatever amount we emit into the atmosphere , we must also remove ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely .\nBig polluting nations like the United States , China and Russia not only continue to burn fossil fuels at an alarming rate but also continue to drill for more oil .\nChina—the world 's biggest emitter , responsible for more than a quarter of humanity 's total emissions—and Russia have pushed their own net-zero targets to 2060 .\nIndia has pushed it to 2070 .\nThat is kicking the climate can down the field , to be dealt with by future leaders .\n( A quick glance at a graphic created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep drop in emissions that China must undergo to achieve its own target underscores the magnitude , and perhaps folly , of winning the war against the climate crisis . )\nIn the United States , a divided nation has ossified a gridlocked legislature that has n't passed many game-changing climate laws .\nMuch environmental protection has been exercised through executive actions , such as regulations imposed by federal agencies , which can be simply overturned by the next administration .\nWhen a Democrat is in the White House , environmental protection is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican is in the White House , it 's more about protecting polluters .\nThe country lacks the necessary strong federal and state climate legislation to protect people and the environment from toxic , global-warming pollution , protect fenceline communities ( which are often poor communities of color and Indigenous communities ) and hold polluters to account .\nOne of the bright spots of the summit was a landmark $ 19 billion agreement between more than 100 nations—together responsible for about 85 percent of the world 's forests—to end deforestation by 2030 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the climate fight as they prevent around one-third of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion .\nBut in a press statement , Dan Zarin , the executive director of forests and climate change at Wildlife Conservation Society , said that the Glasgow Climate Pact `` does not mean that the world has solved the climate crisis . ''\nHe pointed out that even if all the participating nations ' pledges to reduce emissions ( known as `` nationally determined contributions '' or `` NDCs '' ) were achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 percent reduction needed by 2030 to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius .\nIn the Glasgow Climate Pact , countries only agreed to strengthen their NDCs by the end of 2022 .\nPresident Joe Biden , who attended the summit , hailed the forest agreement , which aims to restore almost 500 million acres of ecosystems , including forests , by 2030 .\n`` We 're going to work to ensure markets recognize the true economic value of natural carbon sinks and motivate governments , landowners and stakeholders to prioritize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plan will `` help the world deliver on our shared goal of halting natural forest loss . ''\nBut activists were less enthused .\nThe forest agreement `` is one of those oft repeated attempts to make us believe that deforestation can be stopped and forest can be conserved by pushing billions of dollars into the land and territories of the Indigenous Peoples , '' said Souparna Lahiri of the Global Forest Coalition , an international coalition of NGOs and Indigenous Peoples ' organizations defending the rights of forest peoples .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of Indigenous peoples are relatively weak '' in the Glasgow text , said Jennifer Tauli Corpuz , a lawyer from the Igorot people in the Philippines and chief policy lead at Nia Tero , a nonprofit advocacy group for Indigenous peoples .\nSpecifically , she said that `` [ w ] e will have to watch closely the implementation of [ COP26 's ] new carbon scheme , '' referring to the finalization of rules that will manage the creation of the international carbon market , and were part of the 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of Indigenous representation in the final text of the Glasgow Climate Pact , people from poorer island nations that are most susceptible to the impacts of sea level rise were also underrepresented at the talks , mainly due to COVID-19 restrictions .\nJust three out of 14 climate-vulnerable Pacific island states were able to send delegates to COP26 , while the fossil fuel industry sent more tha",

The federal minimum wage in the U.S. has remained glued at $ 7.25 an hour for the last 12 years , the longest stretch without a boost since it was first adopted in 1938 .\\nYet there 's another revealing figure that underscores how the minimum wage — created by Congress after the Great Depression as a way to ensure that Americans were fairly paid for their labor — has failed to keep up with the times .\\nEven as workers have been more industrious — helping drive corporate profits , the stock market and CEO compensation to record heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even declined when factoring in inflation .\\nIf the minimum wage had kept pace with gains in the economy 's productivity over the last 50 years , it would be nearly $ 26 an hour today , or more than $ 50,000 a year in annual income , one economist notes .\\n`` That may sound pretty crazy , but that 's roughly what the minimum wage would be today if it had kept pace with productivity growth since its value peaked in 1968 , '' wrote Dean Baker , senior economist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research , in a recent blog post .\\nProductivity — how much income someone generates in an hour of work — is critical for the economy because it helps determine a country 's standard of living .\\nYet rising productivity is no guarantee of a healthy economy .\\nEqually important is how the fruits of productivity are divided .\\nTo that end , `` Having the minimum wage track productivity growth is not a crazy idea , '' Baker said .\\nA recent CBS News poll found that most Americans support a hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that cut across socioeconomic status .\\nNationwide , nearly 250,000 workers earn $ 7.25 per hour , while roughly 865,000 earn less than that , labor data show .\\nTo be sure , dozens of states and cities have boosted their baseline wages over the past few years , especially in areas with a high cost of living such as California , where the minimum wage is now $ 14 an hour for employers with at least 26 workers .\\nYet the federal minimum wage remains in effect in 20 states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker 's analysis comes at an uneasy time for millions of workers across the U.S. , even as they celebrate Labor Day .\\nThe COVID-19 Delta variant means many white-collar workers wo n't return to the office until 2022 , while many lower wage workers continue to cope with the risk of getting infected , not to mention confrontations with anti-mask or anti-vaccine customers .\\nInequality also widened during the pandemic , with the wealth of the richest Americans surging as stocks soared , while those at the bottom were more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also more likely to work in jobs where they faced a great chance of catching COVID-19 .\\n`` Dean makes an important point .\\nWhether or not you should argue it should be $ 26 , it is a very strong point illustrating what has been happening with our economy , '' said Ken Jacobs , the chair of the University of California , Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education .\\nSince the 1970s , `` We have seen that complete divorce between wages and productivity and massively increased inequality with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ''\\nA $ 26 an hour minimum wage might strike some as unrealistic , with Baker noting that his analysis is more of a `` thought experiment '' than a practical proposition .\\nFor one , more than tripling the federal baseline wage would result in a host of undesirable economic effects , from a spike in unemployment ( as employers would need to cut jobs in order to pay the workers they could afford to keep on ) to higher inflation .\\n`` The problem is that we have made many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of income upward , so that we can not support a pay structure that gives workers at the bottom $ 52,000 a year , '' Baker wrote .\\nSo what happened in the 1970s that decoupled the minimum wage from productivity gains ?\\nThe weakening of unions over the past several decades is believed to be one cause , eroding the ability of workers to collectively bargain and win wage gains and other concessions .\\nOrganized labor is now at its lowest membership levels in the modern era , with only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union in 2019 , down from 2 in 10 in 1983 .\\nAt the same time , wage gains have increasingly gone to college-educated workers , a trend that accelerated after the Great Recession , as employers outsourced or automated jobs , reducing their need for modestly paid workers .\\nThe current administration is aiming to shore up unions , with President Joe Biden vowing to be `` the strongest labor president you have ever had . ''\\nDemocratic lawmakers have supported the Protecting the Right to Organize ( PRO ) Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize and bargain collectively .\\nLabor Day was created by the labor movement more than a century ago to celebrate the American worker .\\nBut the past year has n't been a happy one for many of the nation 's 161 million workers .\\nFor one , 9.1 million workers are losing pandemic unemployment benefits on the holiday as the aid expires .\\nThere 's not much recourse for those who are still struggling with unemployment , with the Biden administration saying it wo n't extend the federal jobless programs .\\nAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading across the nation , there are signs of economic headwinds , notably a sharp slowdown in hiring .\\nThat effectively creates a Catch-22 , according to Daniel Kuehn , a research associate at the Urban Institute .\\nAlthough businesses and institutions like schools must reopen — and stay open — for the labor market to continue healing from the impact of COVID-19 , the Delta variant 's rapid spread argues in favor of shutting down to safeguard public health .\\nAlready , more than 3 million workers say they 're sitting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching or spreading the virus .\\nThe loss of pandemic jobless benefits `` is going to be a disaster , and it 's an ironic disaster to happen on Labor Day , '' Kuehn said .\\n`` What gets people back to work is businesses and society opening back up and having income to spend .

live on , even if she is no longer with us , ” Vartivarian told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she would have wanted me to do and I believe in what she was doing .\\n“ I always trusted her instincts and would ask her , ‘ What do you think about this ?\\n’ I still ask her sometimes , but of course , she doesn ’ t answer now , ” she added .\\n“ A platform like AD Leb is needed in Lebanon and the region .\\nI have faith in this venture that she had embarked on and wanted it to be realised.\\n” All profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gaia Fodoulian Foundation , an organisation founded to support and care for animals in need and provides assistance for animal rescuers – a cause that Fodoulian cared deeply about .\\nFodoulian had set aside some funds to produce her own design pieces – a pair of modular benches that could be made from concrete or wood , which she designed as a graduate student at Milan ’ s Istituto Marangoni .\\nVartivarian took the designs and had the benches produced for AD Leb ’ s inaugural exhibition .\\nGaïa Fodoulian ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one before she died in the blast [ Maghie Ghali/Al Jazeera ] The exhibition ’ s title comes from the photo caption of Fodoulian ’ s last

before the blast .\\n“ Even though she had a strong personality she was also very sensitive , which is what made her look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s why she posted that post at the last minute , that she knew her soul was leaving the world behind , ” Vartivarian said .\\n“ I was so intrigued to know what was in her mind when she made that post .\\nI thought about that caption a lot … So I proposed it to the artists in the show , kind of like Gaia ’ s last instruction to me maybe .\\n“ I can ’ t say for sure what she had envisioned but if I start doubting everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added .\\n“ She always used to ask me for my opinion on her designs and work , so I ’ m treating it like that now.\\n” The pop-up show brings together both newly commissioned and existing works by artists and designers Samer Bou Rjeily , Karen Chekerdjian , Hatem Imam , Sirine Fattouh , Paul Kaloustian , Nathalie Khayat , Hussein Nassereddine and Caroline Tabet .\\nKhayat ’ s work “ Light Sleepers ” is directly linked to last year ’ s tragedy , with an installation of 208 porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in the blast .\\nEach Raku-fired piece is unique , created with abstract shapes and moulded on impulse , glazed in a variety of colours .\\n“ I made them in a very short period of time , so it was very intense work .\\nI like that they have their own individuality and each carry their own story , ” Khayat told Al Jazeera .\\n“ I like to work with the idea of rituals .\\nFor me , lighting a candle is a ritual by itself .\\nIt ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different occasions , it carries a different meaning behind it .\\nIn this context , it ’ s a tribute for the people who lost their lives on August 4.\\n” Other projects take a broader approach to the theme of faith and belief , such as Nassereddine ’ s sculptural installation “ The Red Castle , As It Occurred ” , inspired by a poem by the famous Abbasid poet Abu al-Mutanabbi .\\nHe presents a tall limestone column , the material probably used to build the castle originally , tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era formula .\\nThe piece draws attention to how something small led to an incorrect belief for centuries , simply because it was written down somewhere .\\n“ He was describing a battle happening around this red castle , and for centuries it was believed so , because there are no remains of this castle now , all that remains is this poem , ” Nassereddine said .\\n“ It was believed the castle was built from brick or red stone , but more archaeological research showed that there were no structures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red materials and it was only the poet ’ s imagination.\\n” Each work is given its own room , spread across the first two floors of the spacious heritage building , with scenography designed by Ghaith & Jad .\\nVartivarian wanted something with more history than the usual white-walled galleries or industrial warehouses often used .\\nBuilt in the late 19th century and expanded during the French Mandate era , the building bears the characteristic lavishly decorated vaulted ceilings , triple arcade window , and geometric-tiled floors of many Lebanese heritages home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 800 heritage buildings that suffered damage during the blast , as most of Beirut ’ s Ottoman architecture lies close to the port .\\n“ It just so happened that the owner of the building had passed away during the blast and also the building has been affected , ” she said .\\n“ I felt something in this building , its character and that there was a connection between the building and the exhibition.\\n” AD Leb hopes its use of the space will attract interest and result in proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has partnered with NGO Silat for Culture to organise free tours of the exhibition and the building ’ s history .\\nAD Leb also has plans for a 3D video of the exhibition to reach outside audiences and an online programme of talks and on-site performances .\\nIt hopes to schedule four exhibitions a year , featuring regional artists and collaborations with international practitioners and institutions .\\nVartivarian aims for the platform to offer some hope to the Lebanese cultural

– is to accept defeat , to fall into despair .\\nIn order to carry on , day in and day out , I have to believe that eventually things will get better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hard to muster the energy , or

On Monday evening , Debra Haaland , a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblo of Laguna , became the first Native American ever to be confirmed as a Cabinet secretary .\\nWhen she testified in February at her confirmation hearing , Haaland began her opening remarks by introducing herself to senators in her tribal language of Keresan .\\n`` This historic nature of my confirmation is not lost on me , but I will say it 's not about me .\\nRather , I hope this nomination would be an inspiration for Americans moving forward together as one nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Haaland said .\\nShe grew up in a military family and later became a single mother who struggled to stay above the poverty line .\\nHaaland eventually earned a bachelor 's degree in English from the University of New Mexico when she was 34 .\\nTwelve years later she earned her J.D .\\nin Indian law from University of New Mexico School of Law .\\nBefore she was elected to Congress in 2018 , Haaland served as the tribal administrator for the San Felipe Pueblo for almost two years and then chaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same year , she and Kansas ' Sharice Davids became the first Native American women to serve in Congress .\\nShe made history again when President Biden nominated her to lead the Interior Department .\\n`` If an Indigenous woman from humble beginnings can be confirmed as secretary of the Interior , our country holds promise for everyone , '' Haaland said .\\nThat feeling of promise is shared by other Indigenous people who spoke with CBS News about the significance of Haaland 's confirmation .\\n`` I just think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to visibly see someone who looks like him , someone who comes from his same community , who is at that level , '' said Valerie Siow , an educator and Laguna Pueblo Native .\\n`` Sometimes I ca n't even believe it .

''\\nLanguage is meaningful to the Pueblo people , says the former director of the Native American Studies program at the University of New Mexico , Dr. Gregory Cajete , a Tewa Indian from Santa Clara Pueblo .\\nAnd so is land .\\nThe Laguna Pueblo , west of Albuquerque , is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 4,000 people .\\nThe Pueblo have maintained their culture , traditions and language in large part because they have never been entirely uprooted from their homeland .\\n`` That makes us a little different than a lot of other tribes in the United States , '' Cajete explained .\\nHaaland pointed out during her confirmation hearing that the land occupied by the U.S. Capitol was the ancestral homeland of the Nacotchtank , Anacostan and Piscataway people -- a Native custom .\\nThe Pueblos ' devotion to their culture has not shielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered over the centuries .\\nThis , according to Cajete , is precisely what makes Haaland 's confirmation as interior secretary , a position in which she 'll oversee federal lands and the Bureau of Indian Affairs , so poignant .\\n`` Many of the issues of tribes with the United States -- and earlier , at least in the Pueblos , with the Mexican government , and earlier with the Spanish colonial government -- have been around land .\\nAnd because we are a land-based people , our spirituality , our sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our livelihood is directly tied to the land and has been for centuries , '' he said .\\n`` That is one of the reasons why Indigenous peoples fight tenaciously for their land rights because of the innate understanding that culture and a sense of homeland is essential to the continuation of the tribe or tribal tradition , '' he added .\\n`` A lot of people do n't really understand the relationship that Indigenous people to this country have had with the federal government .\\nThere 's a whole history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced removal of our people , '' she said .\\n`` `` It 's kind of hard to explain outside of Indigenous circles but our way of life is so connected to [ the land ] , '' she said .\\n`` The land always calls us home .

After a steady increase in pressure from outside groups and questions from the media , the Biden administration officially decided on Friday to break its pledge to lift President Donald Trump 's strict limits on refugee admissions for the fiscal year ending in September .\\nDespite previously pledging to raise the cap on refugees from the extremely low level of 15,000 to 62,500 , Biden has reversed himself .\\nDuring the presidential campaign , Biden pledged to raise the cap to 125,000 in the next fiscal year , and as recently as February , Secretary of State Tony Blinken had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this fiscal year would be increased more than fourfold .\\nMany observers had become increasingly worried about Biden 's commitment to following through on this objective as the weeks dragged on without official action .\\nSome reports indicated Biden was worried about the `` optics '' of raising the refugee cap .\\nCNN 's Kaitlan Collins on April 8 pressed White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the issue given the delay , and Psaki insisted Biden was committed to the increase : But on Friday , the fears of refugee advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden is a cowardly betrayal of his many supporters who were horrified by Trump 's aggression toward and disregard for asylum seekers and refugees .\\nPrior to the revelation of Biden 's reversal , The Atlantic writer Adam Serwer said on Twitter : `` Biden 's delay in reversing Trump 's discriminatory refugee restrictions is a violation of his campaign promises and the reasons he gave for running in the first place . ''\\nIn a new piece , he wrote : So far , Biden has done a lot that is popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Rescue Plan , proposing a big infrastructure and spending package .\\nAnd he may fear that increasing the refugee cap is unpopular and will derail the momentum that he has .\\nIndeed , one Morning Consult poll found that increasing refugee admissions was the only major Biden priority that was unpopular .\\nBut one reason for passing popular policies that meet people 's needs is to have more cover and trust with the public when taking values-based policy steps that might trigger some discontent .\\nAnd it 's not as if raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — he campaigned on letting in more refugees , so he should n't feel the need to shy away from it now .\\nIt is one of the easiest ways for a president to drastically improve a large number of human lives , saving families from dire conditions in refugee camps , with little or no downside .\\nAnd there 's likely no upside at all to breaking this promise .\\nThe anti-immigrant right wing will not give Biden any credit at all for backing down ; instead , it will likely just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further .\\nThey 'll cite Biden 's capitulation on this promise as evidence that refugees really are a problem , and perhaps say that letting in any refugees is a problem .\\nThis is a particularly terrible time for Biden to be retreating on the immigration issue , too , because anti-immigrant bigotry is resurgent .\\nFox News 's Tucker Carlson , an influential leader in conservatism , is openly endorsing the white supremacist `` replacement theory , '' which Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson recently echoed .\\nAnd on Friday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new , openly nativist caucus based on `` Anglo Saxon political traditions .

unvaccinated loved one to COVID-19 to contact them for a story .\\nAs of September 29 , 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments , and the vast majority are about someone who was injured or died from the COVID

reported .\\nThis , despite the fact that both the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require any suspected injury from an emergency use vaccine to be reported .\\nOne of the reasons O ’ Malley decided to come forward , knowing she will likely lose her job over it , is because one of her coworkers who was coerced into taking the shot died .\\n“ Nobody should have to decide between their livelihood or take the vaccine , ” O ’ Malley says .\\nShe also points out that while there are medications such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Considerations on the Great Reset and the New World Order For more than a year and a half we have been helplessly witnessing the succession of incongruent events to which most of us are unable to give a plausible justification .\\nThe pandemic emergency has made particularly evident the contradictions and illogicalities of measures nominally intended to limit contagion – lockdowns , curfews , closures of commercial activities , limitations of public services and classes , suspension of citizens ’ rights – but which are disavowed daily by conflicting voices , by clear evidence of ineffectiveness , by contradictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\\nThere is no need to list the measures that almost all the governments of the world have taken without achieving the promised results .\\nIf we limit ourselves to the presumed advantages that the experimental gene serum should have brought to the community – above all immunity to the virus and renewed freedom of movement – we discover that an Oxford University study published in The Lancet stated that the viral load of those vaccinated with a double dose is 251 times greater than the first strains of the virus , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi , according to whom “ whoever gets vaccinated lives , whoever does not get the vaccine dies.\\n” The side effects of the gene serum , cleverly disguised or deliberately not registered by the national health authorities , seem to confirm the danger of taking the vaccine and the disturbing unknowns for the health of citizens which we will soon have to face .\\nThe art of medicine – which is not science , but the application of scientific principles to different cases each time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have renounced its prudence , in the name of an emergency that has risen to the level of priesthood of a religion – the religion of science , in fact – which in order to be such has cloaked itself in a dogmatism bordering on superstition .\\nThe ministers of this cult have constituted themselves as a caste of untouchables , exempt from any criticism even when their claims are denied by the evidence of the facts .\\nThe principles of medicine , considered universally valid until February 2020 , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of being advised to vaccinate at the height of the pandemic , the obligation of masks being imposed although they are useless , the arbitrary mandating of bizarre distances , the prohibition of treatments with effective drugs and the imposition of experimental gene therapies in violation of normal safety protocols .\\nAnd just as there are new Covid priests , so there are also new heretics , that is , those who reject the new pandemic religion and want to remain faithful to the Hippocratic Oath .\\nNot infrequently , the aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less titled scientists does not seem to be questioned due to their conflicts of interest or by the substantial financial benefits received by pharmaceutical companies , which under normal conditions would be scandalous and criminal .\\nWhat many fail to understand is the inconsistency between the stated aims and the means that are adopted in a constantly changing manner in order to achieve them .\\nIf in Sweden the absence of lockdowns and masks did not lead to higher infection rates than those in countries where people have been confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks put on even in primary schools , this element is not considered as proof of ineffectiveness of the measures .\\nIf in Israel or in Great Britain mass vaccination has increased infections and made them more virulent , their example does not induce the rulers of other countries to be cautious in the vaccination campaign , but rather pushes them to evaluate the mandatory nature of their giving of the vaccine .\\nIf ivermectin or hyperimmune plasma prove to be valid treatments , this is not enough to authorize them , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder the reason for this disconcerting irrationality end up refraining from judgment , giving a sort of fideistic acceptance to the pronouncements of the Covid priests , or conversely considering doctors as unreliable sorcerers .\\nAs I said earlier , we are faced with a colossal deception , based on lies and fraud .\\nThis deception starts from the premise that the justifications put forward by the authorities in support of their actions are sincere .\\nMore simply , the mistake consists in believing that the rulers are honest and in assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we persist in finding more or less plausible justifications , with the sole purpose of not recognizing that we are the object of a conspiracy planned to the smallest detail .\\nAnd while we try to rationally explain irrational behavior , while we attribute logic to the illogical actions of those who govern us , cognitive dissonance leads us to close our eyes to reality and to believe the most shameless lies .\\nOnce it is understood that the present events have been intended in order to obtain certain results – and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a minority part of humanity , with incalculable harm for the majority – we must also have the honesty to recognize the criminal mens [ mind ] of the authors of this plan .\\nThis criminal design also makes us understand the fraud perpetrated by civil authority in presenting certain measures as an unavoidable response to unpredictable events , when the events have been artfully created and magnified with the sole purpose of legitimizing a revolution – which Schwab identifies as the fourth industrial revolution – intended by the elite to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority is on the other hand the result of a process that began even earlier , with the French Revolution , and which made the

between a person ’ s death and the administration of the gene serum .\\nThey twist the truth with impunity when it does not confirm their narrative , bending it to fit their purposes .\\nWhat has been

       "  '‘Radicalisation’ and the assumption of Muslim manipulability. In an insightful piece for Harper ’ s Magazine , Joseph Bernstein , a senior reporter at BuzzFeed News , questions the idea that disinformation spread on social media platforms in the last five years , rather than long-term societal conditions , is responsible for the crisis of faith in democratic institutions that has swept the West in the age of Brexit and Donald Trump .\\nFor example , he argues that “ the mosaic of experiences that form the American attitude towards the expertise of public-health authorities ” is a better explanation for vaccine and mask hesitancy , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why have we been so eager to accept Silicon Valley ’ s story about how easy we are to manipulate ?\\n” he asks .\\nBernstein traces the presumed power of social media companies to dubious mid-century academic studies , citing sociologist Jacques Ellul who in the 60s wrote that such studies tended to “ regard the buyer as victim and prey ” .\\nHowever , conspicuously missing , especially as the anniversary of 9/11 approaches , is the tale of how this view has been supercharged by America ’ s 20-year Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real sense , this is chickens coming home to roost .\\nThe idea of “ radicalisation ” , “ counter-radicalisation ” and “ de-radicalisation ” is built on a similar assumption of the manipulability of Muslim societies and people .\\nRather than consider that there could be specific grievances underlying the resort of a minority to terrorist violence , the US and the West preferred to blame it on “ radical ” preachers spreading anti-Western propaganda – the Facebook of the Middle East , one might say .\\nFaced with a rejection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at worst , honest though tragic innocence , broadcast by mainstream media , governments and academics in Europe and North America found comfort in portraying Muslim populations as simple-minded and easily entrapped by the spells cast by angry , bearded clerics in flowing robes .\\nThis is the same view Bernstein is seeing being reproduced in the West itself to understand their own non-compliant populations , a minority of whom also pose serious terrorism threats .\\nGovernments with an authoritarian bent in the non-Western world have also latched onto the idea of “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their subjects over their policies .\\nThe Kenyan authorities , for example , who for the last six decades have continued the colonial policies of marginalising and oppressing the country ’ s Muslim and especially ethnic Somali population , paid little more than lip service to this history – which has been extensively documented by a Truth , Justice and Reconciliation Commission which collected more than 40,000 witness statements – when confronted with discontent and terrorist attacks committed by local actors .\\nEven though 90 percent of such attacks occurred after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was little acknowledgment that may have something to do with it .\\nInstead , the history was flipped on its head and the invasion justified on the basis of what it inspired .\\nFurther , the government , with the media in tow , took its cue from the US and blamed “ radical ” preachers for the violence , even targeting some for extrajudicial execution .\\nThis is not to say that radical preachers extolling violence have no effect – they clearly can influence a small minority of their followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to disinformation on social media platforms in the West and elsewhere , their impact has been greatly exaggerated , and their audiences infantilised , by those with an incentive to do so .\\nAgain citing Ellul , Bernstein argues that propaganda or incitement would not be effective without “ pre-propaganda ” – which he equates to the entire social , cultural , political , and historical context .\\nOne can think of this context as the soil in which the violent ideas spread by the clerics can take root in particular individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox News or radical preachers can lead to perverse “ solutions ” that entrench problems and privilege “ acceptable ” propaganda .\\nIn her excellent talk on the limits of media literacy at the 2018 SXSW EDU conference in Austin , Texas , Danah Boyd , founder of the research institute Data & Society , points out that “ fundamentally , misinformation is contextual ” meaning what constitutes propaganda depends on who is labelling it .\\n“ The difference between what is deemed missionary work , education and radicalisation depends a lot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” she says .\\nShe argues that the culture wars waged between “ progressives ” and “ conservatives ” in the US are actually arguments over epistemology – how you know what you claim to know – that can not be resolved through fact-checking or compromise .\\nShe sees the efforts of many liberal elites to debunk the beliefs of Trump voters as “ assertions of authority over epistemology ” and the propagation of a single , acceptable truth or worldview .\\nOn the global stage , where the Global War on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods used to wage them into what Samuel Huntington called “ a clash of civilisations ” , this assertion of a singular truth channelled through Western prophets that negates the experience of much of the rest of the world , has been at the root of de-radicalisation efforts .\\nYet , they can have the opposite effect .\\nAs Boyd puts it , “ nothing can radicalise someone more than feeling that you are being lied to.\\n” The views expressed in this article are the author ’ s own and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial stance .',\n",

After more than two weeks of negotiations during the United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow , Scotland , diplomats from almost 200 nations finally agreed on two major points : ramp up the fight against climate change and help at-risk countries prepare .\\nSpecifically , governments agreed to meet again next in 2022 with more robust plans to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent by 2030 , significantly reduce emissions of methane ( which has even more global warming potential than CO2 ) , and nearly double the aid to poor countries to help them mitigate the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to initiate reductions in coal-fired power and to begin slashing government subsidies on other fossil fuels , representing the first time a COP text mentioned coal and fossil fuels .\\nAcknowledging the deal is imperfect , U.S. climate envoy John Kerry registered his support .\\n`` You ca n't let the perfect be the enemy of the good , and this is good .\\nThis is a powerful statement , '' he said .\\n`` We in the United States are really excited by the fact that this raises ambition on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement represents a step forward , it has been roundly criticized by scientists , climate activists and representatives from small , poorer nations who will feel the brunt of the climate impacts much sooner than big , richer ones .\\nShauna Aminath , environment minister of the Maldives , denounced the final COP26 deal as `` not in line with the urgency and scale required .

Prominent business leaders are asking lawmakers to reject several election-related bills that they deemed attempts to suppress voting in Arizona , a move that comes as Georgia faces calls for boycotts

purge inactive voters from the state ’ s Permanent Early Voting List , require voters to add proof of identification to their early ballots and limit the early voting period before elections .\\nThe statement came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members Adam Goodman and Sharon Harper , who co-chair the group ’ s public policy committee , that ran in the Arizona Capitol Times in early March .\\nThe new

— plain and simple , ” the statement read .\\nThe op-ed referenced a number of bills that were introduced earlier in the legislative session but have died since , often without so much as a hearing in committee .\\nThose proposals , some of which garnered national media attention , included legislation that would abolish Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate early voting entirely .\\nOthers would have

the paranoia that has plagued our political discourse over the past several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals have one thing in common : making it more difficult for Arizonans to vote , ” the statement read .\\nThe new iteration of the statement on Friday focused on three bills in particular , two of which still have a good chance of being passed into law .\\nOne , Senate Bill 1485 , would remove inactive voters from the Permanent Early Voting List .\\nVoters who don ’ t use their early ballot in at least one primary or general election for two consecutive election cycles would receive a

and Lonnie Phillips avoid using the words “ assault weapons ” or “ gun ban ” in their column .\\nInstead , the couple are talking up the idea of the White House creating a couple of new in-house offices to push for gun control efforts .\\nWe urge President Biden to consider the following avenues of action : Create the Office of Gun Violence Prevention to establish a long-term , sustained effort to reduce gun deaths in America by classifying gun violence as a national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority , and make a commitment to cut all forms of gun lethality by 50 % by 2026 , including suicide , homicide , and unintentional shootings .\\nCreate a National Firearm Injury Prevention Bureau .\\nThanks to the work of the National Transportation Safety Board , transportation-related death rates have plummeted over the years .\\nExperts have successfully implemented the most effective ways for people to survive hurricanes , tornadoes , fires , and even tsunamis .\\nOur country desperately needs to learn how to design buildings , create floor plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape public shootings like the mass shooting that claimed our Jessi nine years ago .\\nFind ways to hold accountable gun manufacturers and sellers who sell guns and ammunition without completed background checks , or who use false advertising to sell firearms .\\nThe Phillips ’ also , however , “ urge all leaders ” , Biden presumably included , to “ read the Denver Accord to learn the most effective policies to reduce gun violence.\\n” What ’ s the Denver Accord ?\\nIt ’ s an anti-gun wish list put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all kinds of new gun control laws , including ( but not limited to ) : • a “ permit to purchase ” law that would allow law enforcement to deny gun purchases even for those who pass a background check .\\nWhile the Phillips are not alone in their calls to clamp down on the Second Amendment in the name of public safety , the man who prosecuted their daughter ’ s killer isn ’ t one of them .\\nI actually conducted my interview with former Arapahoe County D.A .\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ever learned about the couple ’ s forthcoming column , but by chance the very first question I posed to him was whether or not his involvement in cases like the Aurora attack had made him rethink his support for the Second Amendment .\\n“ Any normal person would sit there and think ‘ Okay , what is that we can take away from this where we could do something that might make a difference in the future , ' ” Brauchler responded .\\n“ But the conclusion that I ’ ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no change in the law that we have enacted as a result of these that would have prevented the crimes.\\n” As Brauchler points out , after Aurora shooting , the state legislature in Colorado rushed to ram through several new gun control measures , including a universal background check law and a ban on magazines that can hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition .\\n“ I ’ m here to tell you , as the guy who lived that Aurora theater massacre case for years , neither of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have actually prevented that massacre , ” Brauchler emphatically told Bearing Arms ’ Cam & Co. “ You have a guy who had a crystal clean and crystal clear criminal history who walked into four different gun shops and purchased four different guns legally .\\nHe also brought with him to that theater 700 rounds of ammunition and numerous magazines .\\nHad there been a magazine capacity limit in effect then he would have just brought more magazines , but it would have done nothing to prevent that .\\nSo as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course you think to yourself ‘ what could we do legislatively that won ’ t infringe on the Second Amendment but at the same time provide some extra security or prevention , ’ and thus far there hasn ’ t been a thing that we ’ ve done that would have made a difference to these major crimes.\\n” We ’ re going to have Brauchler back on the show before long , because there ’ s a lot more to talk about from his perspective as a prosecutor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ’ s interview , which delves into the enforcement ( or lack thereof ) of Colorado ’ s mag ban and universal background check laws and why the former D.A .\\ndoesn ’ t believe they serve any sort of preventative benefit at all .\\nWhile I disagree with their positions , I do understand why some victims of violent crime like the Phillips ’ choose to focus on the tool that their daughter ’ s killer used in the commission of his evil act .\\nI don ’ t begrudge them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a grievous mistake both from a civil rights and public safety perspective for the country at large to adopt their views as our own .\\nAs Brauchler makes clear , in a nation where the right to own a gun is enshrined in our Constitution and exercised by more than 100-million citizens , there ’ s simply no way that we ’ re going to ban and arrest our way to safety .\\nUltimately we have to deal with

The family members are heartbroken about what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two things : one , do not let this crime committed by teenagers be a reason to eliminate gun rights in the United States of

views on the Second Amendment or gun control .\\nHowever , I do think it ’ s important that news outlets at least report on Abbott ’ s comments , because the media generally follows a narrative after

tend to lose interest in what they have to say .\\nThe media ’ s preferred narrative after a shooting is that more gun control laws would have made a difference , and they tend to focus on those

stopping these types of crimes .\\nIt doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their guns than their kids , or that they ’ ve become bought and paid for tools of the “ gun lobby.\\n” It simply means that they ’ re

Fresh off the mass shooting in a grocery store in Boulder , it ’ s unsurprising that Colorado has embraced still more gun control .\\nIt ’ s kind of the natural order of things in Democrat-controlled states , which Colorado definitely is .\\nOn Monday , Governor Jared Polis signed two gun control bills into law .\\nNeither of which would have stopped the Boulder shooting , but for once , no one really seems to be claiming they would .\\nStill , they only make life more difficult for the good guys .\\nGov .\\nJared Polis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colorado into law – the first new firearm restrictions enacted in the state since the red flag bill became law in 2019 .\\nThe legislation was introduced before the deadly attack on a Boulder King Soopers in March , though the shootings brought greater urgency to the measures , which are mainly focused on reducing gun-related suicides .\\nOther gun-control bills are expected to be debated at the Legislature later this year .\\nThe legislation signed into law Monday , which passed the Legislature without any Republican support , will affect all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re designed to reduce gun-related suicides , yet none of them address the underlying causes of suicide , namely mental health .\\nFunny how that ’ s how it always shakes out , isn ’ t it ?\\nAnyway , here ’ s what Polis signed into law : Starting on July 1 , Coloradans who own guns will be required to store their weapons in a gun safe or with a trigger or cable lock when the owner knows or should reasonably know that a “ juvenile or a resident who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the firearm.\\n” The guns don ’ t have to be stored in a safe or with a trigger or cable lock if the owner is carrying the weapon or if he or she places it in a “ secure container which a reasonable person would believe to be secure.\\n” Antique firearms are also exempt from the law .\\nIn other words , screw it if your kid is actually responsible enough to be trusted with a firearm .\\nThe state knows your kid better than you because they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined they apply universally .\\nYes , that sounds ridiculous .\\nThat ’ s because it is .\\nMeanwhile , locked firearms are guns that cant ’ be readily accessed in an emergency .\\nThat can actually cost lives , all without any promise that such laws will actually save any .\\nAfter all , suicidal people who are determined to kill themselves will simply find another method .\\nOf course , if that was all Colorado was dealing with , that would be enough .\\nThe bill requires gun owners to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement within five days of realizing the weapon is missing .\\nFailing to report a lost or stolen firearm is a civil offense punishable by a $ 25 fine .\\nA second or subsequent infraction is an unclassified misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $ 500 .\\nLaw enforcement agencies that receive a report of a lost or stolen gun must enter available descriptive information about the weapon into the Colorado Bureau of Investigations Crime Information Center Database .\\nNow , I ’ m a believer that people should report lost or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law that attempts to enforce that as a requirement .\\nFirst , determine someone actually knew their gun was stolen ?\\nProve it .\\nSecond , a first offense fine of a whopping $ 25 is bound to make a statement .\\nHonestly , laws like this are meant to try and address straw buyers .\\nWhen approached by law enforcement , they claim the gun was stolen , which is how it got into a criminal ’ s hands .\\nI get the desire to address this , but there are legitimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns are stolen .\\nIt ’ s well past time to go after criminals for criminal behavior and to stop trying to wrap up every gun owner as a part of the same web .\\nIt ’ s insulting and downright offensive .\\nFrankly , I don ’ t see either of these laws doing much except jamming up good , law-abiding people over absolutely nothing .\"],\n",

UK-based business leaders , suppliers and entrepreneurs to discuss the UK-EU ’ s new trading regime .\\nDespite the government ’ s pledge that the UK-EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the EU , given the agreed zero tariff and zero quota regime , there have been widespread reports of disruption for UK companies that trade with the EU since the Brexit transition period ended .\\nSmaller to medium businesses

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan announced the Biden administration ’ s plan to address pollution from a persistent and widespread class of man-made chemicals during an event Monday at N.C. State University .\\nFrequently called “ forever chemicals , ” per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — or PFAS — consist of thousands of chemicals that are used in a wide array of human activities from hamburger wrappers to non-stick pans .\\nThe same hard-to-break-down qualities that make the chemicals valuable also mean that they pose a risk to those who are exposed to them .\\nPFAS compounds have been detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Wilmington to wells around Chemours ’ plant near Fayetteville to Maysville to Pittsboro .\\nSome PFAS compounds have been linked with health impacts ranging from increased risk of some cancers to reduced immune system effectiveness to decreased fertility .\\nBut there are thousands of compounds and many have not been studied , making regulation a challenge .\\nThe EPA ’ s PFAS plan sets out to clean up existing contamination , keep additional chemicals from being released , and lead to additional research .\\nThe agency will set what it calls an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water limits ; it will designate PFAS as a hazardous substance under federal Superfund laws ; and it will review previous actions the agency has taken under the Toxic Substances Control Act to find any that didn ’ t provide enough protection .\\nAdditionally , the EPA will embark on a testing effort requiring manufacturers of PFAS to provide toxicity information about categories of the chemicals , with more than 2,000 chemicals grouped together by their features .\\n“ It would take EPA decades to do this on our own at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but instead the polluters who are poisoning our nation ’ s waterways will be responsible for conducting and paying for this work , ” Regan said of the testing effort during an announcement by Lake Raleigh .\\nThe first orders for toxicity information will be sent in a matter of months , Regan said , adding that he is “ certain ” some PFAS found in North Carolina will be among the first with mandatory testing .\\nRegan served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality from 2017 until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .\\nGov .\\nRoy Cooper , who hired Regan in North Carolina , joined him during Monday ’ s remarks .\\n“ These chemicals are impacting communities all across the country , and so as I ’ ve been traveling all across the country , it ’ s been chilling to see how many stories mirror the experience we had here in North Carolina , ” Regan told The News & Observer .\\nThe EPA ’ s actions are based on the work of the agency ’ s Council on PFAS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in April to develop recommendations .\\nIn his memo creating the Council on PFAS , Regan cited his experience in North Carolina .\\n“ In North Carolina , I also wanted strong federal leadership .\\nNow , as the EPA ’ s Administrator , tackling this problem will be one of my top priorities .\\nWe will take meaningful action , following the science and following the law , to better understand and ultimately reduce the potential risks caused by these chemicals.\\n” Cooper echoed Regan ’ s comments about wanting additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly under former President Donald Trump .\\n“ We needed more action and more support with Washington but found ourselves disappointed time after time .\\nUntil now .\\nNow , it ’ s here , ” Cooper said .\\nIn 2017 , the Wilmington StarNews reported on an N.C.

       "  'China Demands Canada Punish Diplomat for Wu-Tang Clan T-Shirt. The diplomatic crisis between China , Canada , and the Wu-Tang Clan escalated on Thursday with China ’ s demand for disciplinary action against Canadian diplomat Chad Hensler , identified as the alleged architect of a modified Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt that ostensibly outraged China by mocking the city of Wuhan .\\nChina is an authoritarian Communist nation in Asia .\\nCanada is a liberal democracy in North America .\\nThe Wu-Tang Clan is a hip-hop group of uncertain administrative structure .\\nWuhan is the city in China where the global coronavirus pandemic originated , although the Chinese Communist Party wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about that .\\nCanada ’ s foreign service scrambled to evacuate as many of its citizens as possible from Wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak .\\nChad Hensler turns out to be the employee of the Canadian embassy in Beijing who decided to order novelty commemorative T-shirts in the summer of 2020 for the staffers who coordinated the evacuation .\\nAttentive Chinese sleuths identified Hensler by noticing his name on the shipping label for the T-shirts , which became a sensation on Chinese social media last week .\\nAs Canada ’ s Globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on evacuating Canadians from Wuhan took to calling itself the “ Wu-Han Clan ” in a riff on the hip-hop group ’ s name .\\nHensler evidently decided it would be amusing to order novelty T-shirts that combined the famous Wu-Tang Clan logo with Wuhan ’ s name .\\nAccording to Canadian Foreign Affairs officials , the shirts were purchased with private funds .\\nThe Chinese government has been working with comical intensity to prove the innocent T-shirts were in fact a coded smear against Wuhan and the Chinese state .\\nEach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Canadians has been met with shrill accusations of elaborate cover-ups and fervent insistences from Chinese officials that the Wu-Tang Clan logo looks like a bat , the creature often blamed for spreading the Chinese coronavirus .\\n( For the record , the Wu-Tang Clan thinks their logo looks like a flying guillotine ) .\\nThe latest in a string of sputtering broadsides from China ’ s state-run Global Times on Thursday made WuTangGate sound like the most elaborate conspiracy since the assassination of JFK : Sources close to the matter revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imply a bat-like symbol with the words of “ Wuhan ” around it in order to imply the coronavirus originated from a bat in Wuhan as part of a Western-led smear campaign against China on the question of the virus origins .\\nHe had sought companies that produce T-shirts with culture symbols as early as in May 2020 , and after he contacted one Chinese e-commerce firm , he had been hesitating to provide the image to be printed on the T-shirts until July after he spent over two months to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its turnover situation , the source said .\\nMeanwhile , the Chinese firm noticed that something went wrong with the image , so it refused the orders Hensler made several times , the source said on the condition of anonymity .\\n“ But he was in a rush .\\nFacing questions from the Chinese firm , he lied that the word ‘ WU-HAN ’ was just ‘ a line of Canadian words , ’ representing it ’ s cool , ” the source said , noting that such a plan showed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image .\\nThe Global Times paused its tirade to note that Hensler was “ fully satisfied with the product quality , ” because it is very important to stress that Chinese merchants sell good products , even when they are helping rogue Canadian hip-hop fans provoke an international incident .\\nThe Wu-Tang Clan ’ s first single , “ Protect Ya Neck , ” was about literal decapitation , but the Global Times said China would graciously settle for his metaphorical scalp : When the Canadian government has been trying to find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-level diplomat , the Global Times learned that Hensler has been working at the Canadian Embassy to China for many years and now takes the position as a high-level diplomat .\\nSome Chinese analysts said “ it ’ s hard to believe that a diplomat living in China for many years would not realize the implication of the image amid a smear campaign launched by certain Western politicians on COVID-19 .\\nSome considered it a “ stupid mistake ” made by the Canadian diplomat who may have been echoing the smear campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence .\\nIt is beyond our belief that senior diplomats who have been working and living in China for years could make such a stupid mistake inadvertently , [ Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin ] said on Wednesday .\\n“ Serious damages have been done by such wrong actions .\\nThe Chinese people also find this very repulsive and difficult to accept .\\nThe Canadian side should take this case seriously and give us a serious and unequivocal explanation , ” Wang said .\\nBesides making it clear that China intends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the coronavirus came from , the real issue underlying this absurd controversy is Canada ’ s detention of Communist Party royalty Meng Wanzhou , the chief financial officer of the Huawei telecom corporation , wanted by the United States on charges of fraud and violating sanctions against Iran .\\nMeng has been under house arrest in Canada since December 2018 .\\nThe T-shirt images began spreading across China ’ s tightly controlled Internet right after a Canadian judge denied Meng ’ s request for more lenient bail terms .\\nThe judge insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to mitigate Ms. Meng ’ s risk of flight to an acceptable level , ” a statement that likely outraged the Communist officials who tell Chinese “ netizens ” what they should be outraged about .\\n“ Relations between China and Canada have experienced huge challenges over various issues such as the arrest of Huawei ’ s senior executive Meng Wanzhou and hyping on conspiracy theories about the novel coronavirus origins , ” the Global Times asserted , neatly summarizing the relevant issues , none of which have anything to do with @ @ @ @'],\n",

       "  'What next as Israel steps up attacks on Iranian forces in Syria?. A spate of deadly Israeli air raids and other attacks have created a conundrum for Iran and its intentions in Syria .\\nWhile Israel has worked to counter Iran ’ s efforts to extend its influence in Syria for a decade , recent developments indicate an increased push to eradicate the Iranian presence , raising questions about what comes next .\\nIsrael ’ s latest wave of attacks on January 12 in eastern Syria was broad and precise .\\nA total of 18 positions – mostly militias supported by Iran – were hit about 600km ( 320 miles ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth attack attributed to Israel in a two weeks .\\nIran , a major supporter of President Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime , has built a significant military presence in Syria since the civil war began in 2011 .\\nThe build-up of forces has been regarded by Israel as a threat to its national security .\\nAlthough officially neutral in Syria ’ s civil war , Israel has continuously conducted air raids against what it says are Iranian targets since 2012 , a strategy to stop Tehran and its proxies from elevating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of crucial importance to Iran as it plays a key logistical role in enabling Iran to provide support to the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon , Simon Mabon , professor of international politics at the University of Lancaster , told Al Jazeera .\\n“ If Assad had fallen , it would have posed a serious challenge to the provision of logistical support , ” Mabon said .\\nIsrael has become more forceful in its efforts to counter Iran ’ s presence since al-Assad ’ s military victory over various rebel forces raised fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sides in the event of an armed conflict .\\nIn such a scenario , Israel would not only face Syria but Hezbollah , sponsored by Tehran , on its northern border and Hamas in Gaza in the south .\\nRecently , there has been a significant shift in the number of attacks .\\nIsrael seldom comments on the raids , and therefore reliable figures are difficult to obtain .\\nHowever , the Israeli army ’ s Chief of Staff General Aviv Kochavi recently said Israel had struck more than 500 targets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to multiple clandestine missions ” .\\nThe timing of the most recent attacks , which overlaps with the final days of the Trump administration , was particularly noteworthy , Nader Hashemi , director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver , told Al Jazeera .\\n“ It is a direct result of an Israeli foreign policy goal of getting the United States to attack Iran on Israel ’ s behalf , ” said Hashemi .\\nIndeed , prior to the attacks launched on January 12 , Israel conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in close proximity to the capital Damascus on January 7 .\\nReports said three pro-Iran fighters were killed .\\nAccording to Israel , its main objective appears to have benefitted from the intensification , according to Kochavi : “ Iran ’ s entrenchment in Syria is slowing down as a result.\\n” However , Hashemi said the raids ’ effectiveness remains unclear .\\n“ What is apparent is that Iranian assets have been repeatedly targeted with impunity.\\n” While he acknowledged Israel ’ s stepped-up military efforts , he said he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful operation .\\n“ Iran has attempted to downplay its presence in Syria , largely because this is very unpopular back in Iran , so the actual number of dead IRGC [ Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ] soldiers and commanders has never been publicly revealed , ” said Hashemi .\\nMoreover , Iran will increasingly anticipate Israeli attacks and take the necessary precautions to limit casualties , particularly as “ there are limits to what Israel can do from the air ” , he added .\\nNonetheless , the deadly air raids have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions in Syria .\\nIran ’ s efforts to advance its interests in Syria are not military only .\\nTehran has invested in the country ’ s education system , building secondary schools and opening universities across Syria .\\nIt has also set up medical centres that distribute COVID vaccines and masks to Syrians in response to the pandemic .\\nThis is an approach Iran has utilised for many years throughout the Middle East , and which it is now using in Syria : “ Teheran has a vast experience of engaging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lebanon , where it has developed a good deal of influence through soft power , ” Mabon said .\\nWith a reported allocation of $ 20- $ 30bn over the past decade , Syria has been a costly endeavour for Iran .\\nConsidering the country ’ s perilous economic situation , this raises the question of how long Tehran ’ s overseas activities can be sustained in the region – particularly in light of Israel ’ s determination to check them .\\nIran ’ s domestic circumstances notwithstanding , however , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anytime soon , analysts say .\\n“ Iran has faced serious economic challenges before , but it continues to fund Hezbollah in Lebanon and provides support to PMUs [ Popular Mobilisation Forces ] in Iraq , ” Mabon noted .\\nIts engagements remain “ inherent within Iran ’ s foreign policy goals ” but considering Israel ’ s dedication to countering Iran ’ s presence , it “ leaves Tehran ’ s regime with a difficult balancing act to engage with ” , he said .\\nBesides the economic aspect , Iran is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after its top foreign operations commander , Qassem Soleimani , was assassinated in a US drone strike in January 2020 .\\nSoleimani ’ s death has “ undermined Iran ’ s position both in Syria and Iraq , ” Afshin Shahi , senior lecturer in Middle East politics at the University of Bradford , told Al Jazeera .\\n“ Soleimani had the ability to build alliances and run asymmetric warfare unrivalled in the region , ” traits his successor Esmail Qaani lacks , which is “ excellent news both for Israel and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” , said Shahi .\\nWith limited leeway on either side to pivot from their respective objectives , a swift conclusion to the Iran-Israel conflict in Syria or a change in strategy remains inconceivable .\\n“ I do not see any changes forthcoming , ” Hashemi said .\\n“ At most , there might be a reduction in the intensity and regularity of these attacks given that [ US President ] Joe Biden has zero interest in going to war with Iran , but I do not see these bombing raids halting altogether.\\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s minister of defence , Naftali Bennett , stating unequivocally Israel ’ s intention to “ not stop ” its military efforts until it has forced Iran out of Syria .\\nAnd while Tehran is nowhere near close to ceasing its entanglement in Syria , Israel has undoubtedly made its involvement uncomfortable and costly for Iran .']}"

         "Algeria has been in turmoil since early 2019 .\nA popular anti-government street protest movement , called Hirak , gathered massive support across different ethnic and social segments of the society and is still ongoing .\nTo this , the government has responded with laws and measures that limit freedom of expression , and has often justified that by the need to fight the pandemic .\nThe Hirak movement started on February 2019 , a few days after president Abdelaziz Boutefikla , in power since 1999 , announced he would run for a fifth mandate .\nThe people of Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 .\nEventually , Boutefikla conceded defeat and resigned on April 2 , 2019 .\nYet , his resignation did not bring changes expected by a majority of Algerians .\nThey therefore continued to protest peacefully every single Friday across the country to press for significant political changes and an end to large-scale corruption .\nAs this Twitter account that monitors the Hirak movement explains , the issue at play is the mindset of the government which is perceived as using various arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip over society : The authorities did eventually respond to the movement by holding presidential elections in December 2020 , which were won by Abdelmajid Tebboune .\nYet , the vote was largely boycotted , reflecting little confidence within significant parts of the population in his candidacy as many Algerians did not see him as much different from his predecessors .\nIndeed , while Tebboune had initially expressed support to the Hirak movement , he eventually changed his views and supported the passing of legislation restricting digital freedom of expression in Algeria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in legislation during the pandemic The first significant change happened in April 2020 .\nThe Algerian parliament and senate voted amendments to the Penal Code which introduced heavier sentences in the context of peculiar situations , including times of pandemic .\nVillage de la justice [ Justice Village ] , a online publication established by legal experts , explains this in its article : More coercive legislation under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights

under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights

their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis ’ 83 in 2006 .\nPlus , some agonizing history in Atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 .\nThe Braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year .\nThe Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season .\nAnd then there was the big one , the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl .\nBut these Braves , not this time .\nFavored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title , the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July .\nEarlier , 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy .\nProjected ace Mike Soroka never got back from an Achilles injury .\nGoing into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork .\nThey had a guy who made his big league debut in October , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago .\nToss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew .\nMany continue to heckle them as the “ Cheatin ’ Astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever .\nCertainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker .\nA World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century .\nThe 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones , aces Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux and John Smoltz , and manager Bobby Cox .\nThose rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles .\nThe 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season .\nHis 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park , and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 Boston Braves , too , dubbed the “ Miracle Braves ” back in the day .\nIn last place on the Fourth of July , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A ’ s — to earn their nickname .\nThe Braves ’ previous title came at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , their first home after moving from Milwaukee to the Deep South in 1966 .\nThen there was Turner Field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled Minute Maid Park .\nQuite a change from last October .\nOnly a limited capacity was permitted for that World Series as the Dodgers beat Tampa Bay at a neutral-site stadium in Arlington , Texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus .\nNow , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months .\nA squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport .\nIn the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal .\nAstros : Scheduled to start the spring training schedule on Feb. 26 vs. St. Louis .",

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today .

: Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide

, I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to

structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed

wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

         "Algeria has been in turmoil since early 2019 .\nA popular anti-government street protest movement , called Hirak , gathered massive support across different ethnic and social segments of the society and is still ongoing .\nTo this , the government has responded with laws and measures that limit freedom of expression , and has often justified that by the need to fight the pandemic .\nThe Hirak movement started on February 2019 , a few days after president Abdelaziz Boutefikla , in power since 1999 , announced he would run for a fifth mandate .\nThe people of Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 .\nEventually , Boutefikla conceded defeat and resigned on April 2 , 2019 .\nYet , his resignation did not bring changes expected by a majority of Algerians .\nThey therefore continued to protest peacefully every single Friday across the country to press for significant political changes and an end to large-scale corruption .\nAs this Twitter account that monitors the Hirak movement explains , the issue at play is the mindset of the government which is perceived as using various arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip over society : The authorities did eventually respond to the movement by holding presidential elections in December 2020 , which were won by Abdelmajid Tebboune .\nYet , the vote was largely boycotted , reflecting little confidence within significant parts of the population in his candidacy as many Algerians did not see him as much different from his predecessors .\nIndeed , while Tebboune had initially expressed support to the Hirak movement , he eventually changed his views and supported the passing of legislation restricting digital freedom of expression in Algeria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in legislation during the pandemic The first significant change happened in April 2020 .\nThe Algerian parliament and senate voted amendments to the Penal Code which introduced heavier sentences in the context of peculiar situations , including times of pandemic .\nVillage de la justice [ Justice Village ] , a online publication established by legal experts , explains this in its article : More coercive legislation under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights

under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights

their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis ’ 83 in 2006 .\nPlus , some agonizing history in Atlanta , a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995 .\nThe Braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year .\nThe Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season .\nAnd then there was the big one , the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl .\nBut these Braves , not this time .\nFavored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title , the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July .\nEarlier , 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence policy .\nProjected ace Mike Soroka never got back from an Achilles injury .\nGoing into the playoffs , their bullpen was a crazy patchwork .\nThey had a guy who made his big league debut in October , a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago .\nToss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew .\nMany continue to heckle them as the “ Cheatin ’ Astros ” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title , and those feelings might last forever .\nCertainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker .\nA World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field , he wasn ’ t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over more than a century .\nThe 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones , aces Tom Glavine , Greg Maddux and John Smoltz , and manager Bobby Cox .\nThose rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles .\nThe 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season .\nHis 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park , and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1914 Boston Braves , too , dubbed the “ Miracle Braves ” back in the day .\nIn last place on the Fourth of July , they surged to win the pennant , then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A ’ s — to earn their nickname .\nThe Braves ’ previous title came at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium , their first home after moving from Milwaukee to the Deep South in 1966 .\nThen there was Turner Field before the team uprooted from downtown and decided to sprawl into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outside plazas were jammed over the weekend , and pulsating crowds filled Minute Maid Park .\nQuite a change from last October .\nOnly a limited capacity was permitted for that World Series as the Dodgers beat Tampa Bay at a neutral-site stadium in Arlington , Texas — that followed a total shutout for fans during a regular season shortened because of the coronavirus .\nNow , all of baseball waits to see whether spring training is on deck in a little over three months .\nA squabble between owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport .\nIn the meantime , the sport can savor a year in which things , slowly , started to get back to normal .\nAstros : Scheduled to start the spring training schedule on Feb. 26 vs. St. Louis .",

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today .

: Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide

, I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to

structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed

wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",
