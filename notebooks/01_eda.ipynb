         "Demolition of a large cargo ship along the coast of Georgia is entering its fifth month , with work to chop the ship into eight large pieces going far slower than the salvage crew anticipated SAVANNAH , Ga. -- When salvage crews began cutting apart the capsized Golden Ray , a shipwreck the size of a 70-story office building with 4,200 cars within its cargo decks , in early November they predicted the demolition could be wrapped up by New Year 's Day .\nFour months later , the job remains far from finished .\nBoth ends of the cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by barges in a pair of giant chunks .\nBut roughly three-fourths of the vessel remains beached on its side off St. Simons Island on the Georgia coast , where the South Korean freighter overturned soon after leaving port Sept. 8 , 2019 .\n“ It ’ s been nothing but problems out here , ” said Andy Jones , a St. Simons Island resident who heads to the wreck site in his small fishing boat most days to monitor the demolition and post updates to a YouTube channel .\n“ It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvage experts decided more than a year ago that the Golden Ray , measuring 656 feet ( 199 meters ) long , was too big to remove intact .\nThey settled on a plan to carve the ship into eight massive chunks , each weighing up to 4,100 tons ( 3,720 metric tonnes ) .\nThey straddled the wreck with a towering crane with a winch and pulley system attached to 400 feet ( 122 meters ) of anchor chain that acts as a dull sawblade , tearing through the ship 's hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual cut was supposed to take a single day .\nTaking into account time needed to load each severed ship section onto a barge and prepare for the next slice , the multiagency command overseeing the effort predicted the job would take eight weeks .\nIt 's turned out to be a lot harder .\nThe first cut began Nov. 6 and took three weeks .\nLifting the ship 's bow section revealed battered cars and SUVs in neat , layered rows on the interior decks .\nThe second cut started a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished in a week .\nCrews spent the entire month of February attempting a third cut through the ship 's engine room , a section fortified with thicker steel .\nAfter strain on the cutting apparatus forced extensive maintenance , the salvage crew stopped with the cut only about half finished .\nThey spent days moving the crane to the other end of the ship , where they began cutting a new section May 7 while rethinking plans to complete the unfinished one .\nThe ship 's steel has proven tougher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews have taken pauses to perform extra inspections and maintenance , said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Himes , a spokesman for the multiagency command overseeing the demolition .\n“ If people are wondering when it is going to be done , we ’ re doing it as quickly and as safely as can be done , '' Himes said .\n`` But quick takes a back seat to safety.\n” He said it 's possible the last chunk of the ship could head to the scrapyard by June , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWorkers have taken steps to make the cutting more efficient , using torches to remove strips of the ship 's hull plating and form a guide for the cutting chain .\nThey 're also using a big mechanical claw to pluck cars from inside the ship to shed weight before sections are cut and lifted .\nConservationists worry the longer the shipwreck stays in St. Simons Sound , the greater pollution threat it poses to the area 's waterways , beaches and saltwater marshes .\nThe wreck site is surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanup once the big sections get removed .\nBoats equipped with skimmers and absorbent booms stay on standby to mop up any leaking oil or other pollutants .\nStill , bumpers , tires and other car parts falling from the ship have been found on beaches .\nBirds have been found coated in oil .\nAnd though most fuel has been drained from the ship 's tanks , there 's concern that an estimated 44,000 gallons ( 166,500 liters ) remaining could come gushing out once the cutting chain severs the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the water , the ship or these cars , it breaks down , '' said Susan Inman , coastkeeper for the Altamaha Riverkeeper conservation group .\n“ You have lead paint on your ship .\nYou have all these plastic pieces , hydraulic fluid .\nA lot of this stuff is just going to be around for years.\n” By the time demolition of the Golden Ray began in November , the project had already delayed for several months because of a busy hurricane season and handful of coronavirus infections among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site commanders insisted on removing the ship in large chunks because it was supposed to be faster .\nA year ago , the command fired its original salvage contractor for wanting to dismantle the ship in smaller pieces , saying it would take too long .\nThe jilted firm sued in federal court , but a judge refused to halt the salvage after agreeing there was no time to waste .\nPaul Hankins oversaw planning for a smaller-scale demolition of the Golden Ray until his employer , Donjon-SMIT , lost the job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company .\nHad his team not been fired , Hankins said , the overturned ship would now be a memory in coastal Georgia .\n“ We would have been done , ” Hankins said .\n“ Here we are a year later , and they ’ re nowhere close .\n”"

Dan Sullivan ( R-AK ) voiced his opposition to Stone-Manning in a lengthy statement last week as he emphasized the magnitude of the bureau ’ s influence over his state .\nSullivan called her nomination “ shocking , ” and the state ’ s senior senator , Sen.

Smith , an adjunct scholar with the Tax Foundation and Bloomberg columnist , believes that scenario could be positive , even if he doesn ’ t address the fact home ownership is the main way for the middle class to build wealth .\nSmith argues “ a nation of renters is not something to fear .\nIn fact , it ’ s the opposite.\n” Smith lays out his argument , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of Americans who owned home in 2016 is the lowest percentage since the U.S. Census Bureau starting keeping track of that data in 1984 .\nAnd Smith gave a nod to former President Donald Trump , saying homeownership rebounded during his tenure to 66 percent , “ but that trend is likely to be arrested by a housing market that is desperately short on supply and seeing month-over-month price increases greater than they were in the frenzied market of 2006.\n” Smith argues that single family homes have historically been an “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , the housing landscape has changed : Houses have typically traded with very little liquidity premium .\nThat meant a relatively low purchase price compared to what it would cost to rent — the equivalent of the dividend from housing investment — and stable prices over time .\nThese two factors made houses a good investment for moderate-income families who often lacked the cash and the risk tolerance for market investments .\nAs investments went , single-family homes were cheap and slowly grew in value in both good times and bad .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisals and mortgage underwriting began to change that .\nCombined with the repackaging of subprime loans into presumably safer CDOs , they created a far more liquid market for housing .\nIn response , housing prices soared — and became more sensitive to the vagaries of the markets .\nWhen investors pulled out of CDOs , buyer financing dried up and the whole housing market crashed .\nIt may have seemed at the time like a failed experiment .\nBut financialization had changed the housing market forever .\nHouses are now more prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to see their prices fluctuate with the market .\nThe very features that made home buying an affordable and stable investment are coming to an end .\nSmith also blames the change on people who chose to live in single-family home neighborhoods where their families have privacy and security and oppose forced diversity accomplished by installing multi-family units — “ existing homeowners are reluctant to agree to development with unknowable effects on the value of their most precious investments .\nThe result is less development — and sky-high rents for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home.\n” Smith , however , clearly believes in revising the meaning of the American dream .\nHe thinks corporate investors will see the financial benefits of buying up homes and renting them .\nAnd Americans could be more mobile if not tied down with a mortgage .\nSo he advocates for a nation of renters .\n“ The U.S. is not quite there yet , and not just because too many people are chasing too few apartments , ” Smith concludes .\n“ To see the U.S. as a nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dream of homeownership .\nThis country was always more about new frontiers than comfortable settlements , anyway.\n” Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr @ breitbart.com ."

         "Algerians’ Freedom of Speech Strained by Media Laws Passed Under COVID-19 Pretext",
         "Algeria has been in turmoil since early 2019 .\nA popular anti-government street protest movement , called Hirak , gathered massive support across different ethnic and social segments of the society and is still ongoing .\nTo this , the government has responded with laws and measures that limit freedom of expression , and has often justified that by the need to fight the pandemic .\nThe Hirak movement started on February 2019 , a few days after president Abdelaziz Boutefikla , in power since 1999 , announced he would run for a fifth mandate .\nThe people of Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002 .\nEventually , Boutefikla conceded defeat and resigned on April 2 , 2019 .\nYet , his resignation did not bring changes expected by a majority of Algerians .\nThey therefore continued to protest peacefully every single Friday across the country to press for significant political changes and an end to large-scale corruption .\nAs this Twitter account that monitors the Hirak movement explains , the issue at play is the mindset of the government which is perceived as using various arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip over society : The authorities did eventually respond to the movement by holding presidential elections in December 2020 , which were won by Abdelmajid Tebboune .\nYet , the vote was largely boycotted , reflecting little confidence within significant parts of the population in his candidacy as many Algerians did not see him as much different from his predecessors .\nIndeed , while Tebboune had initially expressed support to the Hirak movement , he eventually changed his views and supported the passing of legislation restricting digital freedom of expression in Algeria .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in legislation during the pandemic The first significant change happened in April 2020 .\nThe Algerian parliament and senate voted amendments to the Penal Code which introduced heavier sentences in the context of peculiar situations , including times of pandemic .\nVillage de la justice [ Justice Village ] , a online publication established by legal experts , explains this in its article : More coercive legislation under the new presidency In Algeria , state media comes under strict control and censorship , delivering information that has to be first approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent platforms such as private media , social media , satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) Interviewed on the phone by GV , El Kadi Ihsane , who owns several independent media outlets , explains the overall context : Subsequently , internet penetration surged by 12 percent between 2019 and 2020 , reaching over 52 percent of the population .\nFollowing the April 2020 amendments to the penal code , Tebboune ’ s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree governing electronic media .\nThe decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria and reflects the mindset of the government as explained in this article by the Minister of Communication : Among the changes brought by this decree , Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain , in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria .\nIndeed , most , if not all , opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect themselves and their families from state harassment .\nWhile Algerian authorities released a number of political prisoners on February 18 , 2021 in an effort to prevent further massive demonstrations to mark the second anniversary of the Hirak movement , the most outspoken voices defending and embodying freedom of expression have all together paid a heavy price for daring to claim their rights .\nAn example of such is Walid Kechida , creator of Facebook page called “ Hirak Memes ” with almost 15,000 members , in which he displays humorous images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement .\nHe was arrested on April 27 , 2020 on charges of “ offending the President ” , a crime that is mentioned in the April amendments of the Penal Code in the context of online publications .\nHe was eventually released on January 31 , 2021 , after nine months in prison .\nSimilarly , Khaled Drareni , one of the most outspoken journalists during the Hirak movement , was released on February 19 , having spent almost one year in prison for allegedly “ inciting unarmed gatherings ” .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist , who did not want to give her full name , told GV : This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries : Uganda , Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Algeria , Nigeria , Namibia , Tunisia , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .\nThe project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights

         "Global Elite Use 3 Giant Financial Companies To Control 88% Of The Corporations Listed On The S&P 500",
         "There is no question that large corporations absolutely dominate our society today .\nThey control what we eat , they control what we watch on television , they own most of the stores that we shop at , they provide the energy that our nation depends upon , and they make almost all of the products that we use .\nTens of millions of Americans make a living by serving these colossal firms , and at this point some of the biggest corporations are larger than many small countries .\nBut of course the corporations aren ’ t the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , and there are 3 giant financial companies that the global elite use to control 88 percent of the corporations that are currently listed on the S & P 500 .\nThe three financial companies that I am talking about are BlackRock , Vanguard and State Street .\nAccording to CNN , those companies have a combined 15 trillion dollars in combined assets under management… But that is actually an old number .\nI wanted to come up with a newer number , and so I started digging .\nAccording to Wikipedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets under management as of January 2021… Vanguard is nearly as big .\nAccording to Wikipedia , Vanguard had $ 6.2 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021… While not as large as the other two , State Street had $ 3.1 trillion in assets under management as of the first month of this year .\nEasiest way to get your first Bitcoin ( Ad ) So adding those numbers up , the “ big three ” had almost 18 trillion dollars in assets under management in January 2021 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit higher by now .\nThat is a giant pile of money that is almost impossible to imagine .\nSometimes people forget just how much money a trillion dollars is .\nIf you were alive when Jesus was born and you spent a million dollars every single day since then , you still would not have spent a trillion dollars yet .\nCollectively , the “ big three ” represent the largest ownership blocks in 88 percent of the companies that are currently listed on the S & P 500… Being the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t mean that you can do whatever you want , but it does give you enormous power .\nFor example , last month BlackRock and Vanguard were instrumental in installing two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors… BlackRock and Vanguard were among the major shareholders whose votes helped to install two new members on ExxonMobil ’ s board of directors , dealing the oil giant a major defeat in the election of board members at this year ’ s annual ( virtual ) shareholders meeting .\nThe two fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of ExxonMobil shares , according to reports , supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No .\n1 , an activist , purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil ’ s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050 , putting shareholder value at risk .\nEngine No .\n1 put forth a slate of four nominees , all with experience in the oil and gas or renewable energy industry .\nExxonMobil did not want these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced to take them .\nAnd these new board members will help to ensure that ExxonMobil becomes more fully aligned with the climate agenda of the global elite .\nFor those in the global elite , it is much easier to use money and power to enact change through corporate structures than it is through various governmental bodies around the globe .\nIn fact , many would argue that in 2021 corporations have far more of an impact on our day to day lives than any governmental entities do .\nUnfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter how those corporations behave because they answer to their owners .\nAt this point , one of the reasons why it seems like so many corporations have a similar culture is because so many of them are controlled by the exact same people at the very top .\nIf you do not conform , you are a lot less likely to be hired by one of these corporations , and if you do get hired you are not likely to rise very far through the ranks .\nWe need to start talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” .\nBecause even though governmental entities may still claim to

''\nDownload , rate and subscribe here : iTunes , Spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to Intelligence Matters .\nIt is very good to have you on the show .\nAnd much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again .\nWINSTON WILEY : Good to talk to you .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , I wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career .\nAnd one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that I would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me .\nAnd I do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to Hawaii .\nAnd I had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday .\nI really took that to heart .\nAnd for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDB staff , briefing the president , serving overseas .\nAnd I just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and I think should be important to them .\nWINSTON WILEY : Oh , well , thank you for remembering that .\nI do n't remember in as much details as you just made .\nIt 's consistent with what I believe and what I tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place .\nI saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better .\nSo my time in CTC and then coming back to be ADDI and ADCI for Homeland Security was kind of true to that .\nAnd I and I tried to share that with as many people as possible .\nAnd I 'm glad you found it useful .\nMICHAEL MORELL : I listened .\nI actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , Winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory .\nBefore we talk about 9/11 , I 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 .\nWe 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later .\nBut but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ?\nWINSTON WILEY : OK. Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today ."

         "Covid: Why has the Delta variant spread so quickly in UK?",
         "The Delta variant of the virus causing Covid-19 has caused infections to spike in the UK once more , preventing the planned relaxation of lockdown in England .\nBut is it really faring worse than other countries ?\nWhere is the Delta variant ?\nLabs around the world that analyse the virus 's genetic material have been sharing their findings to a global database .\nWhen you look at this , the UK looks like it has more cases of the Delta variant than most of the rest of the world .\nBy the week beginning 14 June , 2,853 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , 747 in Germany , 277 in Spain and 97 in Denmark , according to a global monitoring website .\nBut this is not a definitive record of how many cases there are - it 's a record of how many are spotted , and the UK has a very good system for spotting variants .\nSo it 's likely these figures disguise a much greater incidence of the variant in some countries that carry out less sequencing - genetic analysis - of the virus .\nFor example , there were 875 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week beginning 3 May , when the virus was raging , and just 142 in the past four weeks .\nThat 's despite the country recording between half a million and two million new cases a week since the start of May , with Delta believed to be the dominant variant .\nThis does n't mean there is n't a problem in the UK though - cases have generally been falling across mainland Europe .\nAnd some countries that do a lot of sequencing , such as Denmark , have not seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's government has warned that it 's likely to become the dominant strain and the Welsh government says the Delta variant is driving a rise in infection , with the country at the start of a third wave of coronavirus .\nWhy is it so bad in the UK compared with other countries ?\nExperts believe a major factor is the number of cases that were introduced into the UK in a short space of time , because of the volume of travel .\nDr Jeffrey Barrett , from the Sanger Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swabs to work out which mutations they contain , said he believed the true number was likely to be more than 1,000 .\nThis is important because of the irregular way the virus spreads .\nWe talk about the R number meaning that , with no distancing or infection control measures in place , one person might infect three others on average .\nBut in reality , it 's not the case that every single person infects three others .\nInstead , one person might infect 30 others while another person infects no-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their biology , behaviour or living conditions .\nThere 's an element of chance - if five people arrive in the UK carrying the variant , you could get lucky and none of them would pass it on .\nIf 500 come in , it 's just more likely at least one will pass on their infection , or even be a super-spreader .\nSo the difference between five and 500 travellers entering with the Delta variant wo n't be exactly 100 times the infections - it could be the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking off .\nOn top of this , the Delta variant entered the UK at a time when restrictions were being relaxed and in cold weather .\nThe cold snap would have seen more people indoors and thus spreading infection , but also the virus surviving longer outdoors .\nExperts believe some countries may already be heading the same way as the UK - but that they have genetic sequencing programmes which analyse fewer swabs , more slowly , meaning we ca n't see it in the data yet .\nAnd in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been introduced slightly later - perhaps due to fewer people with direct links to the Indian subcontinent - so it could begin to rise in the coming weeks .\nDr Muge Cevik , an infectious disease specialist at the University of St Andrews , said that , in time , we may see a similar trajectory in other countries , adding such a prospect was `` much more worrying in countries with low vaccination rates '' .\nIt is quite likely to become the dominant variant in other countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The variant is considerably more transmissible and we know - including from the example of the Alpha variant first identified in Kent - that the virus eventually finds a way to spread .\nCould it have been prevented ?\nIn January , Sage , the government 's scientific body , had warned that : `` No intervention , other than a complete , pre-emptive closure of borders , or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities , irrespective of testing history , can get close to fully prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' This was after the World Health Organization had classified Delta as a `` variant of interest '' and after it was known to be in the UK , but before it had been designated as a `` variant of concern '' by the UK health authorities .\nAnd , she added , the threat of `` red-listing '' countries may well incentivise them to stop testing and sequencing .\n`` We wo n't be able to completely stop variants coming , '' she said , and the best solution was to vaccinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible ."

and Alexandria , was similarly successful .\nIt was their third attack—an ambitious attempt to bomb two cinemas in Cairo , two in Alexandria and the Cairo railway station—that failed , derailing the operation .\nTen members of the cell were rounded up .\nOf the ten , two committed suicide in the course of their interrogations by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and six were sentenced to prison , eventually making their way to Israel after their release .\nAfter decades of internal Israeli investigations , finger pointing , political scandal and high-profile resignations , the full truth of Operation Susannah remains shrouded in official secrecy .\nThe Israeli government did not even formally acknowledge the incident until 2005 , a full half century after the affair , when nine of the agents were officially commended for their service .\nBut the reasoning behind the operation was revealed during one of the commissions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair .\nAccording to one officer who was given oral instructions directly from Israel ’ s Military Intelligence chief , Binyamin Gibli : In short , the Israelis had attempted a false flag operation , hoping to blame their own spectacular acts of violence on the Muslim Brotherhood or the communists in order to destabilize Nasser ’ s government , undermine Western confidence in its Egyptian ally , and persuade the British military to remain at their Suez base .\nThe operation was a failure in every sense .\nThe cell was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not destabilize the Nasser government , nor did they influence the relationship between Egypt and the West .\nAnd the British did leave their base in 1956 , after an abortive Israeli/British/French invasion of the region was brought to an end by the US and the Soviets .\nBut it did implant an idea in the minds of the Western military planners : that acts of terrorism could be staged and blamed on Muslim scapegoats to further their own political goals .\nAs we shall see , it was not long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own operational plans making use of this tactic .\n.\n.\nplans that would culminate in the most spectacular terrorist attack the world had yet seen .\nTuesday , September 11 , 2001 , dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States .\nIn a matter of moments , however , the quiet of that Tuesday morning transformed into the turbulence of 9/11 and the world seemed to turn upside-down .\nAs the events of that day played out like a Hollywood movie on tv screens around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from clear .\nWho was behind this attack ?\nWhy were they attacking ?\nWhat did the perpetrators hope to gain from it ?\nAnd yet it was there , in the initial hours of those chaotic events—years before the congressional inquiries and presidential commissions presumed to answer those questions—that all of the essential pieces of the official story of 9/11 were laid out on the tv screens of the American public .\nRemarkably , these initial , off-the-cuff speculations turned out to be—according to the various inquiries and investigations that followed—accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden , the mastermind of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization , had planned and directed this attack .\nThe Twin Towers had collapsed due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense .\nThese assertions , drilled into the minds of a susceptible audience still reeling in shock from the horror of the events they had just witnessed , became the core tenets of what would become enshrined in the final report of the 9/11 Commission as the “ official story ” of 9/11 .\nIn this official story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Soviet warrior on the road to peace , ” was now an international terror kingpin .\nRadicalized by the arrival of US military forces in the Arabian peninsula in the Gulf war , he issued a fatwa against the United States and began a series of strikes on US targets ; first bombing the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998 , and then bombing the USS Cole while it was harbored in Aden in October of 2000 .\nAccording to this version of events , the 9/11 plot was hatched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated ” Pakistani militant who presented the “ planes operation “ —as the 9/11 Commission asserts it was originally known—to Osama bin Laden and his chief of operations , Mohammed Atef , in 1996 .\nIt was bin Laden , we are told , who greenlighted the operation “ sometime in late 1998 or early 1999.\n” The three of them developed a list of buildings to be targeted—the White House , the U.S. Capitol , the Pentagon , and the World Trade Center—and bin Laden himself hand-picked the men he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operatives into place over the course of the next two years , this crack terror squad—devoted Muslim radicals willing to die for their beliefs—succeeded through a combination of skill and the colossal failure of the American intelligence complex , hindered by bureaucracy and hampered by a lack of political will to recognize the growing threat of Islamic terror .\nNo individual was to blame for this “ failure , ” the official story of 9/11 concludes , but the remedy to the problems presented by the 9/11 attack was obvious : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear down the walls between foreign intelligence and domestic policing , implement warrantless surveillance and other legally dubious means of disrupting potential terror threats on the home front , and launch a war on terror abroad to bring the battle to the terrorists .\nBut this narrative , now enshrined as the official history of 9/11—that the 9/11 plot was hatched by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 1996 , that it was directed by terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden and that it was executed by Al Qaeda so flawlessly that the intelligence agencies could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone prevented it— —is now contested in every respect , even by defenders of that official history .\nAs even mainstream authors like Jason Burke were forced to admit , the popular conception of Al Qaeda—that of a top-down organization with a single leader overseeing its operations—was a convenient fiction , created by the FBI so they could prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa .\nIn order to prosecute bin Laden , they had to show that Al Qaeda “ coordinates the activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden , as the leader of the group , bears the responsibility for any actions attributed to the organization .\nEven the 9/11 Commission ’ s final report had to admit that Al Qaeda was less of a mafia-like organization with a capo served by his faithful lieutenants and more of a funding organization for “ terrorist entrepreneurs.\n” “ Al Qaeda ’ s worldwide terrorist operations , ” the report conceded , “ relied heavily on the ideas and work of enterprising and strong-willed field commanders who enjoyed considerable autonomy.\n” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exploration , Origin Story , these “ terrorist entrepreneurs ” included among their ranks renowned international Islamic radicals—like “ The Blind Sheikh , ” Omar Abdel-Rahman—and lesser-known but incredibly prolific terror cell leaders—like Ali Mohamed—whose remarkable abilities to evade State Department watch lists and foment and direct spectacular terror attacks directly under the nose of the intelligence agencies defies explanation .\n.\n.\nunless one assumes , as their closest associates did , that they were working under the purview of those intelligence agencies .\nIn order to better understand this aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to 1990 , the year that the specter of Islamic terror appeared on the shores of the United States .\nAbdullah Azzam—Osama bin Laden ’ s mentor and co-founder with bin Laden of the Maktab al-Khidamat ( MAK ) , or the “ Office of Services , ” which provided funding , training and an international support network to the “ Afghan Arabs ” during the Soviet-Afghan war—is dead , killed in a car bombing in Peshawar , Pakistan .\nIt is never determined who committed the assassination , but Azzam ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of the jihad movement .\nAzzam had favoured continuing the fight in Afghanistan , pressing for the formation of an Islamic regime in Kabul .\nBin Laden had other ideas ; and now , as the undisputed leader of the old MAK network , he is free to pursue those ideas under the “ Al Qaeda ” banner .\nBut “ Al Qaeda , ” at this point , barely even exists as a propaganda construct .\nDespite grandiose visions of creating “ a unified global jihad movement , ” the withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the war leaves the group ’ s future in doubt .\nBin Laden returns to Saudi Arabia , looking for ways to leverage his family ’ s wealth and power to make a name for himself in the Muslim world .\nMeanwhile , in New York , the era of “ Islamic terror ” in the United States is about to begin .\nMeir Kahane—an Orthodox Jewish rabbi and a convicted terrorist whose anti-Arab views were considered so extreme he was banned from the Israeli Knesset—has just finished delivering a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Marriott East Side Hotel .\nLeaving the podium , Kahane has begun mingling with the crowd .\nSuddenly one man , Sayyid Nosair , draws a .357 Magnum and fires , hitting Kahane twice , once in the neck .\nNosair flees , shooting one of Kahane ’ s supporters in the leg in his rush out the door .\nHis accomplice , Mahmud Abouhalima , is supposed to be waiting at the front door in a taxi to drive him away , but the doorman had waved Abouhalima away moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong cab by mistake .\nWhen he realizes his error , he brandishes the .357 , ordering the cabbie to start driving .\nInstead , the driver scrambles out of the taxi and runs away .\nNosair is forced to flee on foot , racing down Lexington Avenue with his gun still in hand .\nCarlos Acosta , a US postal inspector , tries to stop him , drawing his weapon , but it ’ s too late ; Nosair fires first , hitting Acosta in the shoulder .\nUndeterred , Acosta drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots back , hitting Nosair in the neck .\nBoth Nosair and Kahane are rushed to Bellevue Hospital ’ s trauma unit .\nNosair survives his emergency operation .\nKahane does not .\nThe dramatic events of that November night would culminate in an even more surprising verdict 13 months later .\nNot only was Nosair treated as a “ lone gunman ” acting of his own accord , but he was not even convicted of Kahane ’ s murder .\nDespite such a brazen assassination—perpetrated in a crowded room and followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , convicted instead on four lesser counts , including gun possession , assault and coercion .\nHe was sentenced to just 22 years .\nSo , what went wrong ?\nThe jurors contend that they had “ reasonable doubt ” of Nosair ’ s guilt because “ the prosecution did not offer a witness during the five-week trial who saw the defendant fire the fatal shots ” and—since Kahane ’ s family had opposed an autopsy—the fatal bullet could not be matched to Nosair ’ s weapon .\nBut , in reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs even the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks conceded in a staff statement a decade after the trial : The typically bureaucratic wording of the statement obscures the reality : the NYPD and the District Attorney ’ s office didn ’ t just passively resist the attempts to “ label ” the assassination a “ conspiracy ” ; they deliberately covered up vitally important information that would have unwound that conspiracy and undermined the next decade of spectacular Al Qaeda terrorism .\nImmediately after his arrest , forty-seven boxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in New Jersey .\nAmong those materials were Top Secret training manuals from Fort Bragg and Secret communiqués from the US Joint Chiefs of Staff .\nLest there be any doubt where the materials came from , they even discovered a video of Ali Mohammed ’ s lectures at the Kennedy Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg .\nBut those weren ’ t the only pieces of evidence that connected the Kahane assassination conspiracy—now commonly portrayed as the first act of Islamic terrorism on US soil—to Ali Mohammed , the remarkable CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant who , we are told , was “ Al Qaeda ’ s ” strangely untouchable “ triple agent ” in the heart of the American intelligence establishment .\nEl Sayyid Nosair himself—the 34-year old Egyptian-born janitor with a penchant for Prozac who quite literally got away with murder—was , as it turns out , not unknown to the authorities .\nIn fact , he had been known to the FBI since at least the previous summer .\nThat ’ s when , as it was later admitted , Nosair and a ragtag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a convoy of vehicles with semi-aututomatic weapons and copious amounts of ammo and heading to the Calverton Shooting Range on Long Island .\nFor four consecutive Sundays in July of 1989 , the FBI ’ s elite Special O perations Group—apparently tipped off that “ PLO terrorists were threatening to blow up casinos in Atlantic City ” —followed Nosair ’ s convoy to the shooting range , snapping dozens of photographs of the group engaging in target practice with handguns , rifles and even an AK-47 .\nThe group had set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qaeda ’ s New York office , which , as we have seen , not only operated in full view of the intelligence community but “ doubled as a recruiting post for the CIA seeking to steer fresh troops to the mujahideen ” in Afghanistan .\nAmong those in attendance at the FBI-surveilled target practice sessions : • Nosair himself , brandishing the chrome-plated .357 that he would later use to slay Kahane ; • Clement Rodney Hampton-El , an American-born black Muslim medical technician known as “ Dr .\nRashid ” who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; • Mahmud Abouhalima , known as “ the Red ” for his curly red hair , covered during the sessions by an NRA cap ; • Nidal Ayyad , a Kuwaiti who had taken classes to become a US citizen ; • and Mohammed Salameh , a Palestinian who grew up in Jordan and studied under Abdullah Azzam .\nNot present at those sessions in July , however , was the group ’ s trainer , Ali Mohammed , the remarkable Al Qaeda “ triple agent ” who had been taking weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US Army ’ s Special Forces training center at Fort Bragg to instruct the Al Kifah cell in the techniques of guerrilla warfare , including bomb making and weapons handling .\nNosair and his fellow Al Kifah plotters had been under surveillance by the FBI .\nMohammed , their handler came straight from Fort Bragg , providing them with Top Secret government documents and personally overseeing their training .\nBut , incredibly , none of these points were raised at Nosair ’ s trial for the murder of Kahane .\nFBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bigger plot were ordered to stand down .\nAnd , according to the official history , the boxes of Arabic documents seized from Nosair ’ s house were not translated until years later .\nNosair ’ s not guilty verdict was cheered by his supporters , and the same cadre of Ali Mohammed-trained radicals who had been surveilled at the shooting range by the FBI moved on to plot their next spectacular terror attack : the bombing of the World Trade Center .\nAnd , as would be revealed in dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , too , had an FBI informant at its heart .\nWhen Emad Salem—a former lieutenant colonel in the Egyptian army who arrived in the United States in 1988—began working as an FBI asset , he was not originally assigned to infiltrate Islamic terror groups .\nNo , in 1988 the Cold War was still on and the FBI tasked Salem with penetrating KGB and Russian mafia rings operating in New York City .\nBut by 1991 , things had changed .\nWith the Cold War over , the Bureau ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handler , Nancy Floyd , who appreciated his work , thought the Egyptian informant ’ s background might make him useful to the FBI ’ s Joint Terrorism Task Force .\nSalem ’ s new handlers in the Bureau ’ s counterterror division , Louie Napoli and John Anticev , put him to work infiltrating the groups raising funds for international Islamic terror on US soil .\nHis first priority : insinuating himself into the ring around the Blind Sheikh , Omar Abel Rahman , including El Sayyid Nosair , then on trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Calverton shooting range associates .\nSalem was remarkably successful in his assignment .\nHaunting the trial of Nosair , he soon befriended Nosair ’ s cousin , Ibrahim el-Gabrowny .\nEl-Gabrowny immediately took to the affable Egyptian , introducing Salem to Nosair in jail and describing him as “ a new member of the family.\n” In a mere matter of weeks , Salem was caught on camera as one of Rahman ’ s bodyguards , even personally driving the Blind Sheikh to Detroit to deliver fundraising speeches .\nSoon thereafter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at his Brooklyn apartment .\nThere , after turning up the television in the dining room , explaining that he feared the apartment was bugged , el-Gabrowny sought to recruit Salem for a special mission .\nAt this early stage , the plot was less of a precise plan and more of a vague idea , devoid of details .\nEven the target of the proposed attack was undecided , with Salem being told that the group intended to set off bombs at twelve “ Jewish locations , ” including temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan .\nWithout knowing it and with hardly any effort , Salem had been recruited into an operation that would eventually result in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .\nSalem worked the plot as best he could , meeting more of the Calverton shooting range associates and gathering information from the cell members to pass along to the Bureau .\nAs the preparations for the bombing began to take shape , Salem ’ s role in the FBI sting operation seemed clear : he would lead the cell along , swapping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombs were placed .\nThen , when the cell was ready to strike , the FBI would swoop in and round up the plotters .\nBut that is not what happened .\nSalem ’ s remarkable success in infiltrating an active plot to stage terror attacks in New York—something that most FBI assets fail to accomplish in the course of their career— is , in retrospect , stunning .\nBut not as stunning as the FBI ’ s response to this incredible turn of events .\nAs author and journalist Peter Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel involved in the story , explained in his book , Triple Cross : But in June 1992 , Carson Dunbar—a rising young star in the FBI ’ s New York Office—was appointed to head the counterterror division .\nDunbar and his deputy , John Crouthamel , didn ’ t trust Salem .\nSoon they were trying to get him to submit to additional polygraphs and , eventually , they broke their deal with Salem and demanded he wear a wire .\nSalem refused and withdrew from the operation , shutting the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salem out of the picture , the Ali Mohammed-trained , Blind Sheikh-supported , Al Kifah-connected cell continued on with their plot .\nBut , with internal disputes disrupting their plans , they had to find someone else to actually build the bomb .\nThey found that person in Ramzi Yousef .\nTo this day , despite having been caught , tried and convicted for the World Trade Center bombing , little is known about Ramzi Yousef ’ s origins , or even his identity .\nThe 9/11 Commission—relying on the torture testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely as a “ Sunni extremist ” whose real name was Abdul Basit .\nBut this supposedly devout Muslim fundamentalist is reported to have hung out at karaoke bars and dated b-girls during his trips to the Philippines while his wife and daughters waited for him in Baluchistan .\nEven his birthplace remains a mystery .\nWhat is known is that Yousef learned bomb-making in Osama bin Laden ’ s training camps in Afghanistan in the early 1990s , perhaps from Ali Mohammed himself ; that in 1995 Newsday reported that the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA had any relationship with Yousef ; ” and that in 1999 Swiss journalist Richard Labeviere reported that a “ classified FBI file indicates that he was recruited by the local branch of the CIA.\n” And , like so many of the other key operatives in the Al Qaeda story , Yousef was able to avoid regular screening procedures , waltz across borders with forged travel documents and enter the United States without a visa .\nOn August 31 , 1992 , Yousef and Ahmad Ajaj—a fellow mujahideen who Yousef had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan—flew from Pakistan to the US despite lacking the proper travel documents to do so , a miraculous feat that the FBI has alleged was enabled by “ direct assistance from senior Pakistani intelligence officials.\n” Upon their arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on September 1st , both men were immediately detained by immigration officials .\nAjaj , acting “ loud and belligerent , ” was caught with a crudely forged Swedish passport and taken to a back office for questioning .\n“ The U.S. government was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil , ” the Los Angeles Times later reported , noting that his suitcases were “ stuffed with fake passports , fake IDs and a cheat sheet on how to lie to U.S. immigration inspectors.\n” But that wasn ’ t all ; among his possessions , inspectors also found two handwritten notebooks filled with bomb recipes , six bomb-making guides that included pages from Fort Bragg military manuals , and four how-to videotapes concerning weaponry and surveillance training .\nAjaj was charged with passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison .\nYousef , meanwhile , tried a different approach .\nDressed in “ traditional peasant garb ” and carrying an Iraqi passport without a US visa , Yousef strode confidently up to the immigration inspector and declared himself to be a refugee seeking asylum from the oppressive Iraqi government , politely asking to be admitted into America .\nAfter being questioned and fingerprinted , one alert immigration official noted his links to Ajaj and sought to detain him , but “ there was not enough room in the INS lockup , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he show up at an asylum hearing later .\nYousef then left the airport , took a cab to New York ’ s East Village and immediately met with Mahmud Abouhalima , “ the Red , ” who had trained with Ali Mohammed and who had served as the getaway driver for Nosair before being waved away by the hotel doorman .\nYousef set about professionalizing the ragtag band of misfits , transforming their vague “ Jewish locations ” plot into an altogether more ambitious plan : to plant a bomb in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers of the World Trade Center , collapsing it into the other tower and killing tens of thousands in the process .\nHe got to work immediately , organizing the cell , renting a storage locker across the Hudson River in Jersey City and beginning the five month task of constructing the bomb .\nWithout Salem , the FBI ostensibly no longer had an asset in the cell to watch as the plot took shape .\nBut , if there had been a serious investigation underway , unraveling the cell and discovering their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ajaj , who had been caught with a raft of terrorist training materials and bomb-making guides , remained in contact without Yousef the whole time , speaking to him frequently via the prison phone .\nBut , although those calls were taped , no one from the FBI or any other agency monitored or even attempted to translate those phone calls until after the World Trade Center explosion the following February , and no one traced the pair ’ s flights back to discover that they had both boarded in Pakistan without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for the first leg of their journey to New York .\nSalem even tried one last time to warn the FBI about the cell .\nMeeting his old handler , Nancy Floyd , at a Subway sandwich shop near the FBI ’ s New York office in October of 1992 to collect his final $ 500 cash payment , he informed her that he had heard that the group was planning a new attack and begged her to put surveillance on Abouhalima and Salameh .\nBut it was no use .\nCarson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and all she could do was pass along the suggestion .\nSalem ’ s warning was ignored and no one followed up on the lead .\nThe FBI had followed the Al Kifah plotters to the shooting range , investigated their role in the Kahane murder , had an informant in their midst reporting on their plans for a spectacular terror attack and now another high-level terror operative had been allowed to enter the country and proceed with his activities unmolested , just as Ali Mohammed and the Blind Sheikh before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon on February 26 , 1993 , Ramzi Yousef and Eyad Ismoil , a Jordanian associate , drove a yellow Ryder van into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center , parking on the B-2 level .\nYousef ignited the 20-foot fuse and fled .\nTwelve minutes later , the bomb went off .\nThe bomb—cutting through the parking garage with an explosive force of 150,000 pounds per square inch— might have lacked the explosive force to fulfill Yousef ’ s goal of toppling the towers , but it did wreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand were injured and 50,000 were forced to evacuate the building in the chaotic aftermath of the explosion .\nLearning of the bombing , Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism expert working for the Rand Corporation , remarked : “ We may be talking about the opening salvo of a new conflict for a New World Order.\n” As the investigation into the bombing began , a letter arrived in the offices of various New York newspapers claiming responsibility for the attack .\nThe letter , sent under the name “ Liberation Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : end US aid to Israel , end diplomatic relations with Israel and stop interfering with the internal affairs of Middle Eastern nations .\nIf these demands were not met , the letter promised that 150 suicide soldiers would be ready to commit more attacks , including launching strikes on “ potential Nuclear targets.\n” If there was any doubt about who was behind the explosion , those doubts were quickly dispelled .\nJust two days into the investigation , in one of the FBI ’ s first descents into the pitch-black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast , an explosives enforcement officer from the ATF found the proverbial “ needle in the haystack “ : a part from the Ryder van itself bearing a Vehicle Identification Number .\nThe van rental was traced back to Mohammed Salameh , one of Ali Mohammed ’ s trainees from the Al Kifah center .\nAbsurdly , Salameh was apprehended on March 4 , one week after the bombing , when he returned to the Ryder rental office in Jersey City to reclaim the deposit on the van .\nSalameh ’ s arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of three others in the Al Kifah cell : Nidal Ayyad , Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj .\nIt also led investigators to the apartment of Ramzi Yousef .\nBut it was too late .\nRamzi Yousef had boarded a flight to Karachi the night of the bombing and then vanished , flying from country to country with impunity , plotting assassinations and bombings in Pakistan , Thailand , the Philippines and Iran , and concocting an elaborate plot called “ Bojinka ” to blow up a number of airliners in mid-flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 .\nBut it was not just Yousef himself—the mysteriously protected terror mastermind who had entered the US without a visa—who vanished .\nWhen Pakistani federal investigators later went to check their immigration records , they discovered that all of the documents pertaining to Yousef ’ s journey to the United States in 1992 , including his embarkation card , had “ mysteriously disappeared.\n” In the wake of the bombing , the FBI—now facing enormous public pressure to round up those involved and bust the terror cell that they had infiltrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Emad Salem .\nOnce again , Salem was able to quickly penetrate the Blind Sheikh ’ s cell and to begin working with them on a new scheme , the so-called “ landmarks ” plot to bomb key targets around New York City , including the UN headquarters , the Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge .\nThis time , the FBI arrested the plotters before they could stage their attack .\nBut at the trial two years later , Salem had a surprise for the prosecution .\nHe had secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI handlers , conversations that revealed for the first time the FBI ’ s real role in the World Trade Center bombing .\nPredictably , in the wake of the blast , the debate began to center on the government ’ s “ mismanagement ” of the case .\nThe Blind Sheikh ’ s entry to the US had been a “ mistake.\n” The NYPD ’ s refusal to investigate Nosair ’ s accomplices in the killing of Kahane had just been a politically expedient omission .\nThe FBI having pulled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it developed into the World Trade Center bombing was simply “ incompetence.\n” The presence of a CIA-linked , Fort Bragg-stationed Green Beret in the midst of this radical terror cell was just an example of “ blowback.\n” And Ramzi Yousef ’ s miraculous ability to enter and leave countries at will without the proper documentation was just the result of bureaucratic bungling and overworked immigration officials .\nThe admissions of “ error ” and professions of “ blowback ” verged on admissions of guilt .\nEven the CIA—in an internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Kifah center ’ s operations—concluded that the agency itself was “ partly culpable ” for the World Trade Center bombing .\nBut the “ incompetence ” narrative soon arrived at its inevitable conclusion : the very agencies that had so signally “ bungled ” every step along this path were now to be given more money and bestowed more authority to conduct their “ counterterror ” operations .\nOthers proposed a less charitable reading of these events .\nRon Kuby , the lawyer who , along with William Kunstler , acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their accomplices—did not mince words in assigning blame for the World Trade Center bombing plot : Emad Salem himself summarized the story of the World Trade Center bombing in a phone call with his FBI handler , John Anticev , that was later released to the public .\nIf this pattern of “ missed opportunities ” and “ miraculous ” cross-border movements really had been the result of mere “ incompetence ” or “ inattentiveness , ” then the resources and attention that were thrown at the problem of international terrorism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing would have improved the intelligence agencies ’ record against their erstwhile foes .\nBut , remarkably , the scarcely believable trend of the early 1990s—that of intelligence agencies consistently “ missing ” the terrorists operating directly under their nose , border agents allowing known terrorists to pass from country to country unmolested and law enforcement officials letting these Al Qaeda-linked operatives off the hook—did not just continue into the late 1990s , the trend actually accelerated .\nAnd , as Al Qaeda went from a loose-knit group of a few dozen amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the premiere international terrorist organization at the end of the decade , the number of “ mistakes ” and “ missed opportunities ” multiplied from the merely unbelievable to the downright impossible .\nWhen Mahmud Abouhalima was arrested for his part in the World Trade Center plot in 1993 , he attempted to bargain with federal prosecutors .\nAbouhalima revealed the name of Wadih El-Hage—a Lebanese-born naturalized American citizen living in Texas who the Al Kifah cell had turned to for help in purchasing weapons—and recounted his experiences in Afghanistan with Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would later claim to have provided the rifles and rocket launchers that killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded 73 in Mogadishu in October of 1993 .\nAbouhalima then offered more information about the World Trade Center plot and his associates in exchange for a lighter sentence .\nProsecutors turned down the deal and failed to follow up on either El-Hage or Odeh .\nAli Mohamed , meanwhile , continued in his remarkably successful mission to infiltrate the intelligence arms of the US government .\nAfter having worked for the CIA and served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his next target was the FBI .\nFollowing his honourable discharge from the Army , Mohamed returned to his wife in California and applied to be a translator for the Bureau .\nHe was turned down for the position ; instead , he was asked to work as an FBI informant in a local document forgery ring .\nIn 1992 , the Bureau—evidently impressed with Mohamed ’ s work— “ opened ” him as a Foreign Counter Intelligence agent and tasked him with gaining intelligence on a San Jose mosque .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routine steps like administering a polygraph were never taken .\nAs a retired special agent who worked in the FBI ’ s New York Office later told journalist Peter Lance : “ One of the most unbelievable aspects of the Ali Mohamed story is that the Bureau could be dealing with this guy and they didn ’ t put him on the box .\nThe first thing you do with any kind of asset or informant is you polygraph him and if the relationship continues , you make him submit to continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic principle of running informants.\n” Still , despite repeatedly traveling back and forth to and from the Middle East throughout the period , Mohamed remained untouchable by law enforcement and border security .\nIn 1992 , he was detained in Rome when he was discovered with a Coca-Cola can containing a secret storage compartment .\nMohamed convinced the airport security that he was a security agent for the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and was released with a warning that if anything happened on the flight , he would be blamed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the US on forged documents for a fundraising tour , Mohamed traveled to Vancouver , Canada to help an associate of Zawahiri , Essam Marzouk , enter the country .\nMarzouk , caught with forged Saudi passports by Canadian customs officials , was detained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .\nWhen Mohamed arrived inquiring about his friend , he was detained by the RCMP as well .\nAfter hours of interrogation , he told them he was an FBI asset , giving them the phone number of his handler , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough .\nThe RCMP let Mohamed go .\nMohamed ’ s travels during this busy period included a trip to Afghanistan in the summer of 1991 to help Osama bin Laden and his fledgling Al Qaeda organization relocate to Sudan .\nOsama ’ s move to Sudan came at a time when , we are told , the wealthy Saudi was looking to cement his reputation as a holy warrior .\nThe official story of Al Qaeda holds that during this period , Bin Laden returned briefly to Saudi Arabia but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite US soldiers onto Saudi soil for the Gulf War , left the country for good .\nSearching for a place to move his operations , his gaze turned across the Red Sea to Sudan , where , as luck would have it , hardline Islamic extremist Hassan al-Turabi had come to power in a military coup just as the war was ending in Afghanistan .\nHeading the National Islamic Front Party , which sought to impose sharia law in the country , al-Turabi traveled to London for a meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention to allow Sudan to act as a base for Islamist terror groups .\nBy the summer of 1991 , Osama Bin Laden had answered that call , moving his fighters and equipment from the outskirts of Afghanistan to his new base in Sudan with the help of FBI asset Ali Mohamed .\nTurabi was not the only one traveling to London to foster his terror plans , however .\nIn between Bin Laden ’ s work establishing himself as a businessman in Sudan—using $ 12 million granted him by the Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commercial enterprises in the country , from a construction company to an investment firm to a trucking business to a tannery , a bakery , a furniture-making business and even a commercial farm employing four thousand labourers—the budding terror mastermind was , according to numerous sources , shuttling back and forth between Khartoum , Karachi and London .\nOsama Bin Laden ’ s visits to the UK in the early 1990s include an alleged stay at the London estate of Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz , a meeting in Manchester with representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later accused of being infiltrated by government moles and used to launch a series of false flag attacks in France , a period of several months in 1994 when he actually lived in the UK , allegedly buying a house in Wembley through an intermediate , and , even more explosively , a 1996 trip to his London press office which was—according to Swiss journalist Richard Labeviere , citing “ several Arab diplomatic sources ” — ” clearly under the protection of the British authorities.\n” Although the official story holds that Bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blip on the US intelligence community ’ s radar , this is contradicted by numerous lines of evidence .\nAli Mohamed , for instance , had “ volunteered the earliest insider description of al Qaeda that is publicly known ” to the FBI in 1993 , telling them that Bin Laden was “ building an army ” to overthrow the Saudi government and admitting that he had personally trained terrorists at the camps in Afghanistan and Sudan .\nBut the FBI , according to the Wall Street Journal , was “ flummoxed ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act on it .\nThis “ news ” about Al Qaeda ’ s activities would not have been news to the US government ’ s main intelligence agencies , however .\nIt was later revealed that , despite claims that the US government was only dimly aware of Bin Laden at this point , he was in fact already under extensive electronic surveillance .\nHaving obtained his voiceprint from recordings of his anti-Saddam speeches in Saudi Arabia , the NSA and CIA were already using signals intelligence to identify and monitor Bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell phone traffic .\nIn another key contradiction that is never addressed by the purveyors of the official Al Qaeda story , it was during this period that Osama Bin Laden—making trips to the UK under the alleged protection of British authorities and while admittedly under surveillance by American intelligence—began the streak of increasingly brazen terror attacks that , we are told , would end up in 9/11 .\nIn 1992 , Al Qaeda mounted their first terror operation against an American target .\nIn December of that year , bombs went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was believed , American servicemen were being quartered on their way to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope .\nThe attack killed an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker , but no Americans ; the troops had been staying at a different hotel .\nOsama only claimed responsibility for the bombing six years later .\nIn 1993 , eighteen American soldiers were killed and 73 wounded in Mogadishu during an intense two-day firefight that resulted in the downing of two Black Hawk helicopters by rocket-propelled grenades .\nIt wasn ’ t until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2004 , however , that the commission—citing “ new information ” received by “ the intelligence community ” in “ 1996—1997″—told the public that Al Qaeda had had a role in the incident .\nThe burnishing of Bin Laden ’ s terrorist credentials by the US government continued in 1996 .\nIn January of that year , the CIA officially opened “ Alec Station , ” a so-called virtual station dedicated solely to tracking Osama Bin Laden and his associates .\nHeaded at first by Michael Scheuer—an analyst at the CIA ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special interest in the Saudi exile—and named after Scheuer ’ s son , Alec Station soon became the hub for a mostly-female group of analysts who dubbed themselves “ the Manson Family ” because “ they had acquired a reputation for crazed alarmism about the rising al-Qaeda threat.\n” 1996 was also the year that the US government began putting diplomatic pressure on Sudan to hand over their files on Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda operatives .\nThe secret negotiations between the two countries culminated with Elfatih Erwa , Sudan ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying from Khartoum to Washington .\nThere , Erwa made a stunning offer : not to turn over the Sudanese government ’ s records on Bin Laden , but to turn over Bin Laden himself .\nWashington rejected the offer because , The Village Voice later reported , “ the FBI did not believe it had sufficient evidence to try Bin Laden in a US court.\n” Instead , they demanded that Sudan expel the supposed arch-terrorist to “ any other country except Somalia.\n” Sudan complied , protesting that Osama would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for Washington to negotiate with .\n“ We told him Sudan is no longer safe for him and creates problems for us and asked him to leave , ” Erwa told The Village Voice .\nIn June of 1996 , a truck bomb exploded outside of the Khobar Towers in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia .\nThe facility—located in the heart of the Saudi oil industry ’ s administrative area , where the US had built its first air base and where Standard Oil first struck oil in the country , establishing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied forces involved in enforcing the Iraqi no-fly zones .\nThe massive blast left an 85-foot crater , killing 19 and injuring hundreds .\nAt the time , the US blamed Tehran for the bombing , with Clinton ’ s Defense Secretary William Perry later admitting that there was a contingency plan in place to attack Iran if the link had been proven .\nBut by 2007 , Perry had changed his assessment : One thing is for certain : in 1998 , the $ 150 million contract to rebuild the Khobar Towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAll of these incidents helped to raise Bin Ladens profile in the intelligence community , but it was a series of events in 1998 that introduced the broader public to Osama Bin Laden .\nIn February of that year , Bin Laden—following up on a declaration of war against America that he had made to CNN ’ s TV cameras in an interview with Peter Bergen the previous year—issued his fatwa calling on Muslims to kill Americans : In May of that year , John Miller—then reporting for ABC News , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief spokesman—traveled to Afghanistan for a dramatic Nightline report on “ The Most Dangerous Man You ’ ve Never Heard Of ” that would air on ABC the following month : And , in August of 1998 , the name of Osama Bin Laden , terror mastermind , and his shadowy terror group , Al Qaeda , finally exploded into the public consciousness .\nOn the morning of August 7 , 1998 , two Saudis in Kenya—Mohammed al- ‘ Owhali and “ Jihad Ali ” Azzam , both of whom had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osama Bin Laden earlier that year—loaded some boxes into their Toyota cargo truck and headed off to the American embassy in downtown Nairobi .\nThe boxes contained two thousand pounds of TNT , aluminum nitrate and aluminum powder .\nAt the same time , Hamden Khalif Allah Awad—an Egyptian known as “ Ahmed the German ” for his fair hair—loaded a similar bomb into a gasoline truck in Tanzania and set off for the American embassy in Dar es Salaam .\nThe Saudis arrived at the Nairobi embassy at 10:30 AM .\n‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it approached the gates , demanding that the security guard raise the drop bar protecting the entrance .\nThe guard refused .\n‘ Owhali threw a stun grenade into the courtyard and ran and then the bomb went off .\nThe blast ripped the face off of the embassy building , collapsing a nearby secretarial college and lighting the tar-covered street and a nearby bus on fire .\n213 were dead and 4,500 injured .\nNine minutes later , Ahmed the German parked the gasoline truck in the parking lot of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bomb .\nHe had parked next to a water tanker truck , which ended up absorbing much of the blast , but the building was still badly damaged .\n11 were dead and 85 injured .\nThe message was clear and was dutifully broadcast by media around the world : A “ new ” terror group had conducted a sophisticated , coordinated attack against multiple US targets overseas and its leader was waging holy war against Americans .\nAl Qaeda had arrived .\nBut , like so many events in the Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bore the fingerprints of American intelligence on each stage of its development and execution .\nThe attacks , prosecutors later discovered , were being planned as far back as 1993 , when Osama Bin Laden sent his FBI/CIA/Green Beret triple agent extraordinaire , Ali Mohamed “ to survey potential U.S. , British , French and Israeli targets in Nairobi.\n” According to Mohamed ’ s own testimony : Joining Mohamed on the scouting mission was Anas al Liby , a member of a Libyan Al Qaeda cell known as al-Muqatila .\nDescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qaeda ’ s hierarchy , ” not only was al-Liby personally trained by Mohamed at the Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan , he was also a protected British intelligence asset .\nAl-Liby applied for asylum in Britain in 1995 , claiming to be a political enemy of the Libyan government .\nBut , as The Guardian later reported : Even more incredibly , not only did the British government grant that asylum , they then recruited al-Liby for a failed MI6 operation to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1996 , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country even after the embassy bombing before ultimately letting him escape .\nAccording to FBI investigator Ali Soufan , the Manchester raid didn ’ t just nab a “ manual for jihad ; ” it caught al-Liby himself .\nAs Soufan recounts in his book , The Black Banners , the British police let al-Liby go when he denied being a terrorist .\nHe evaded the team that was sent to follow him and fled the country , eventually ending up on the US government ’ s most wanted list with a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet another important figure in the bombing who was well-known to American intelligence was Wadih El-Hage , the naturalized American citizen who had assisted the Al Kifah plotters and who Mahmud Abouhalima had identified to prosecutors after his arrest for the World Trade Center bombing .\nAs was later revealed , US intelligence had El-Hage under surveillance during the entire period that the embassy bombing plot was being hatched , but once again merely watched as the attack unfolded .\nAs The Los Angeles Times detailed : Author Simon Reeve revealed even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot in his 1999 book , The New Jackals .\n“ The CIA also had informants working within the east Africa cell , ” he reported , citing an interview with a CIA official , “ but they apparently failed to warn of Bin Laden ’ s plans.\n” Even if the CIA ’ s sources within the plot had somehow “ failed ” to warn them of the attack , the fact that multiple members of the cell under their surveillance—including Abdullah Ahmed Abdulah , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , Usama al-Kini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled Kenya for Pakistan the night before the bombing would have instantly raised alarm bells if the agencies ’ intention had been to prevent an attack .\nInstead , the plotters conspired with CIA informants in their midst and the attacks went ahead under the watchful eye of CIA , NSA and FBI surveillance .\nHowever they transpired , the bombings succeeded in introducing Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda to the world stage .\nDespite the years of intelligence agency surveillance and even the creation of a virtual CIA station dedicated solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bin Laden and his network , it wasn ’ t until after the embassy bombings that the world at large began to hear the name of Osama Bin Laden .\nOn August 20th—three weeks after the bombing and just three days after being publicly interrogated about the Monica Lewinsky affair—President Clinton ordered a missile strike on alleged Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan and Sudan , boldly proclaiming that actions against Bin Laden and international terror had become a new mission for the US military .\nThe strike , however—a barrage of 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s camp in Khost , Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant thought to be manufacturing chemical weapons in Khartoum—was a spectacular failure on almost every level .\nNeither Bin Laden nor Zawahiri were killed in the attacks and the “ chemical weapons ” plant in Khartoum had nothing to do with either Bin Laden or chemical weapons , but was in fact manufacturing much-needed medicines for the region .\nThe plant ’ s destruction—in the estimation of Werner Daum , then Germany ’ s ambassador to Sudan—led to “ several tens of thousands ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Zawahiri , Bin Laden ’ s long-time associate and future leader of Al Qaeda , was on one of Bin Laden ’ s monitored satellite phones at the time of the attack , telling BBC journalist Rahumullah Yusufzai that “ Bin Laden has a message .\nHe says , ‘ I have not bombed the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .\nI have declared jihad , but I was not involved . '\n” Zawahiri ’ s exact position would have been immediately detectable by American surveillance aircraft in the region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called “ inexplicable ” —the aircraft were not available prior to the strike and Zawahiri escaped unscathed .\nBin Laden , meanwhile , was—according to CIA intelligence gleaned from intercepted satellite calls—going to be at his training camp in Khost the day of the missile strike .\nBut he was not .\nHe was , Clinton counter-terror czar Richard Clarke later speculated , tipped off about the attack by “ a retired head of the ISI , ” Pakistan ’ s intelligence service that had long been known as an adjunct of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two key respects , however : they kept Clinton ’ s personal dalliances in the Oval Office from leading America ’ s nightly news broadcasts for at least one news cycle and they reinforced the importance of the new threat to global security : Osama Bin Laden .\nThis “ new threat ” provided a green light for the American security establishment and its allies around the world to ramp up operations in the name of fighting the Al Qaeda menace .\nThe FBI began an international investigation of the bombing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting on terror threats that counter-terror officials later complained overwhelmed the system and diverted attention and resources , and in November of 1998 the United States Federal Court finally issued its first public indictment of Osama Bin laden .\nThe first international arrest warrant for Bin Laden—a confidential document intended only for police and judicial authorities—had in fact already been issued in April of that year , but it was not issued by the US .\nInstead , it was the Libyan government that had issued the warrant through Interpol .\nThey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the murder of two German intelligence agents in Libya in 1994 .\nAt the time , despite publicly recognizing Bin Laden as the premier financier of international terrorism , the US and British governments downplayed the document , even making sure to scrub the charges against Osama and any mention of Libya ’ s role in issuing the document from the public record .\nBut this surge in activity around the Al Qaeda threat resulted in at least one surprising development .\nIn one of the most consequential and underreported moves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally arrested .\nContacted in the days after the bombing , Mohamed admitted to FBI agents that he knew who had carried out the attack but would not give the government the names .\nSubpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in the Southern District of New York , he was finally arrested , although even the charges against him were kept secret from the public .\nOn October 20 , 2000 , Mohamed pled guilty to involvement in the embassy bombings , but he was never sentenced .\nHe then disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later reported as “ protective custody.\n” To this day , there is no public record of Ali Mohamed—the ex-US Sergeant and FBI asset who admitted to his key role in Al Qaeda—ever being sentenced .\nThere is no public record of his incarceration .\nAnd there are only a handful of accounts that have ever surfaced from people who talked to him in prison in the aftermath of 9/11 .\nAnd , just like that , one of the deepest mysteries of the Al Qaeda story disappeared from public sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite all this increased activity , the same pattern of “ oversights ” and “ mistakes ” by the intelligence agencies continued unabated .\nOn October 12 , 2000 , when a small fiberglass fishing boat approached the massive , 8,300 ton USS Cole—a billion dollar guided-missile destroyer employing the latest stealth technology and armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles , anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and a five-inch canon—the sailors onboard watched in amusement .\nThe tiny skiff stopped amidships and two men stood up , waving and smiling .\nThen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying over 400 pounds of C4 explosive molded into a shaped charge .\nThe explosion was immense , knocking over cars passing by onshore .\nIn the city , miles away , people believed there was an earthquake taking place .\nThe blast tore a hole forty feet by forty feet in the hull of the Cole , killing 17 US servicemen and injuring thirty-nine more .\nIt was the deadliest attack on a US destroyer in over a decade .\nBut this attack , like all of Al Qaeda ’ s spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded by a string of “ missed opportunities ” and “ unheeded warnings.\n” Not only was there there intelligence about a potential attack on a US naval ship from several different sources—including reports from multiple informants and intercepted phone calls to Al Qaeda ’ s NSA-monitored Yemen communications hub—but , as Congressman Curt Weldon revealed in 2005 , a secret military intelligence operation codenamed Able Danger actually warned the Pentagon days before the bombing that an attack was going to take place in Yemen .\nBut even after the spectacular “ failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack , and despite President Clinton ’ s assurance that he would find and retaliate against the bomb plotters .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nthe CIA repeatedly denied FBI investigators access to key information about the plot .\nBut , it turns out , the CIA did have such information .\nAnd that information—deliberately withheld from the FBI or any other investigative agency—led directly into the heart of the operation behind the next spectacular terror attack to be blamed on Al Qaeda : 9/11 .\nFrom the beginning , 9/11 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case .\nOsama Bin Laden ’ s name was raised on air by the TV news anchors within seconds of the second plane strike and was endlessly repeated in the hours and days that followed .\nBy the end of the week , the public was convinced that the events were the work of Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda and all of the subsequent “ investigations ” and commissions only served to bolster that pre-formed conclusion .\nSo it was no surprise at all when , on September 14 , 2001 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijackers , Muslims with Arabic names who , we were told , had been sent by Bin Laden on a suicide mission .\nBut who were these men ?\nFor the general public , the newscasters ’ solemn intonation that the nineteen hijackers had been identified , followed by a mugshot-like line up of photographs , was all that was needed to cement the case in their minds .\nThose who required more detail turned to made-for-TV dramas and documentaries to learn about the so-called “ Hamburg cell ” of radicalized Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziad Jarrah and Marwan al-Shehhi , three of the alleged suicide pilots .\nFinally , the 9/11 Commission and its associated monographs—like the staff report on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel—attempted to fill in the paper trail for researchers concerned about the documentary record of these men , including their motivations and their movement .\nFrom these accounts , a picture emerged .\nThese nineteen terrorists , crack operatives hand-picked by Osama Bin Laden and trained in his terror camps in Afghanistan , had used their carefully honed spycraft to slip into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as they trained at flight schools in the US and finalized the operational details of their plan .\nThen , after years of meticulous preparation , these men , consumed by their hatred of the West , their love of Allah and their devotion to Bin Laden—deftly piloted their planes into their targets , wreaking havoc and devastation exactly as planned .\nBut this story , too , is a carefully constructed lie , every part of which falls apart under sustained scrutiny .\nIn the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims that they were willing to give their lives for the cause .\nMarwan al-Shehhi , we were told , was so devoted to his religious beliefs that he observed the Ramadan fast against medical advice after a stomach operation , causing him to fall severely ill. Ziad Jarrah , meanwhile , “ initially caroused and smoked ” during his early days in Hamburg but “ then grew intensely religious and withdrawn.\n” And , according to award-winning journalist Lawrence Wright , Mohammed Atta ’ s “ extreme rigidity of character ” made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly demonstrated an aversion to women.\n” When reporters began following the trail that these supposed suicide soldiers had left behind , however , they began to uncover an altogether different story .\nAtta and his associates frequented strip clubs in San Diego , Las Vegas and Daytona Beach , where they drank alcohol and ordered lap dances .\nThey hung out for days at a time at Harry ’ s Bar in New York , where Atta preferred a table near the piano .\nAnd , three nights before the attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar in Fort Lauderdale , where , according to bar manager Tony Amos , they consumed several drinks , became drunk and gave the bartender a hard time about the bill .\n“ The guy Mohamed was drunk , his voice was slurred and he had a thick accent , ” Amos told the Associated Press the day after 9/11 .\nEven the New York Times reported on Atta and al-Shehhi ’ s “ high life ” during multiple visits to the Philippines between 1998 and 2000 , where the pair of strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and their girlfriends flashed money , drank and partied regularly .\n“ Many times I saw him let a girl go at the gate in the morning , ” the Times quoted one hotel chambermaid as recalling about Atta .\n“ It was always a different girl.\n” And , during his research for Welcome to Terrorland—an investigation into the Venice , Florida flight schools where Mohammed Atta , Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah were enrolled in the year 2000—Daniel Hopsicker interviewed Amanda Keller , a former stripper who claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in Venice and who shared more stories about the partying of these alleged jihadis .\nBut Hopsicker ’ s investigation uncovered more than just the alleged hijacker ’ s trail of booze , drugs and women .\nHe also became one of the only reporters to look into the strange connections of Huffman Aviation and the Florida Flight Training Center in Venice , Florida , where Atta , al-Shehhi and Jarrah trained the year before September 11th .\nHuffman Aviation was also the flight school that Yeslam Bin Laden , Osama ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of his acquaintances .\nThe flight school was run by Rudi Dekkers , a Dutch native who was running a commuter airline with Wally Hilliard .\nHilliard—the founder and former president of a Green Bay , Wisconsin-based insurance company—made news in October 2000 when his personal jet was found to be transporting 42 pounds of heroin and was seized by federal agents in what was called the biggest drug bust in central Florida history .\nBut Hilliard ’ s charter airline start-up had high-level political support : Jeb Bush , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ops in support of Hilliard ’ s airline .\nDekkers , meanwhile , was arrested in 2012 , having told an undercover agent—in the words of the criminal complaint against him—that he was “ involved in narcotics transportation via private aircraft and that he has flown narcotics and U.S. currency previously without any problems.\n” He was carrying over 18 kilograms of cocaine and nearly one kilogram of heroin at the time of his arrest .\nDespite the many questions that still hang over the alleged hijackers ’ activities in Venice and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegedly taking place at the Venice airport , an even deeper question was soon to emerge : How did these pilots—who were rated as competent at best and who , one instructor insisted , should have been further along the flight school curriculum than they were—manage to fly jumbo jets that require thousands of hours of flying experience with such precision ?\nThat question is even more important in the case of the other alleged 9/11 pilot , Hani Hanjour , the diminutive 5 foot 5 inch Saudi who , the official story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top Gun honor graduate Chuck Burlingame and his flight crew at the controls of American Airlines Flight 77 .\nAccording to that story , Hanjour allegedly flew a Boeing 757 with what aviation sources for The Washington Post described as “ extraordinary skill ” through a seven thousand foot spiral descent to hit the Pentagon , a move that veteran airline pilot Ed Soliday told the 9/11 Commission would be “ tough for any airline pilot , including himself , ” and which left one radar operator at Dulles Airport stunned : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that he turned , we all thought in the radar room , all of us experienced air traffic controllers , that that was a military plane.\n” But Hanjour , by all accounts , was a completely inept pilot .\nHe dropped out of his first flight school , the Sierra Academy of Aeronautics , after only a few classes .\nHe then dropped out of his next school , Cockpit Resource Management in Scottsdale , Arizona , after the school ’ s owner dismissed him as a “ weak student ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he returned to that school again the following year , the school owner refused , asserting : “ You ’ re never going to make it.\n” An instructor at his next school , Sawyer Aviation , called him a “ neophyte ” who “ got overwhelmed with the instruments ” in the school ’ s flight simulator .\nAn instructor at his next school concurred : Hanjour had “ no motivation , a poor understanding of the basic principles of aviation , and poor judgment , combined with poor technical skills.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial pilot ’ s license from a for-profit contractor , the operation manager at yet another flight school in the Phoenix area , Peggy Chevrette , told Fox News that Hanjour was clearly unqualified to be in the cockpit : “ I couldn ’ t believe that he had a license of any kind with the skills that he had.\n” Even The New York Times conceded that the remarkable flight attributed to Hanjour on 9/11 was inexplicable .\nIn an article headlined “ A Trainee Noted For Incompetence , ” the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew Hanjour as saying : ” I ’ m still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon .\nHe could not fly at all.\n” Whatever the case , what would eventually become the official explanation for this seeming incongruity—namely , that the single engine aircraft training and jet simulation training that they had received was good enough for these men to jump into the cockpit of commercial jet airliners and pilot them hundreds of miles to their targets—was rejected in the first hours of the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September 15 , 2001 , provided one potential answer to this puzzle .\nAccording to a “ high-ranking US Navy source ” cited by the report , “ [ t ] hree of the alleged hijackers listed their address on drivers licenses and car registrations as the Naval Air Station in Pensacola ” and , according to a separate “ high-ranking Pentagon official , ” another of the alleged hijackers “ may have received language instruction at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.\n” But this report—like the subsequent reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged hijackers turning up alive and well in the wake of 9/11 , which prompted the FBI to apologize to one mistakenly named suspect and forced FBI Director Robert Mueller to acknowledge that they were not certain of the identities of several of the named men—were eventually dismissed as mere confusion over common Arab names .\nOn September 28 , 2001 , the FBI released the final list of names and photographs of the alleged hijackers and this rogues ’ gallery of fearsome Al Qaeda operatives was cemented in the public imagination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they really were who the FBI said they were , who directed them ?\nHow were they supposed to have entered the United States ?\nHow did they fund their operations ?\nAnd how did they evade detection while living openly in the US for months and in some cases years ?\nIn the months after the attacks , we were told that the men identified by the FBI as the culprits had “ moved through Europe and America unnoticed ” and that although several of them “ had been tracked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , ” they were ultimately “ lost.\n” We were told that Al Qaeda ’ s communications had been monitored , but that Bin Laden and his henchman used “ scramblers , Internet encryption , fiber optics ” so it was “ very hard ” to intercept those transmissions .\nAnd we were told that no one was to blame for the attacks , which had merely been a “ failure of imagination.\n” But , as the public was to learn in bits and pieces over the course of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions was a demonstrable lie .\nThis alleged team of crack Al Qaeda operatives did not “ move through Europe and America unnoticed.\n” Their communications were not rendered opaque to the intelligence agencies because of “ fiber optics.\n” Their successful penetration of America ’ s defenses was not due to a “ failure of imagination.\n” Instead—as even the official story of the attacks now concedes—every major branch of US intelligence had key pieces of information on these Al Qaeda operatives , their communications , their movements and their plans .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown from official sources , these agencies not only deliberately allowed these operatives to proceed unmolested but actively stopped investigators and agents within their ranks from blowing the whistle on the plot .\nAt the FBI , Special Agent Robert Wright led an investigation into terrorist financing called Vulgar Betrayal that managed to uncover a money trail connecting a suspected Chicago terror cell to Al Qaeda .\nBut when Wright attempted to bring criminal charges against the cell ’ s members , his supervisor flew into a rage , shouting : “ You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid any of you .\nYou will not open criminal investigations against any of these intelligence subjects.\n” After the embassy bombings , when Wright ’ s team began to trace the financing of the attacks to a group of Saudi businessmen , the FBI moved to shut down the investigation altogether .\nWright was kicked off the case in 1999 and Vulgar Betrayal was officially shut down in 2000 .\nWhile Wright was pursuing the financial trail , FBI field agents across the US were picking up on another trend : Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma and Phoenix both wrote memos about the “ large numbers of Middle Eastern males receiving flight training ” and warned that some of them had documentable ties to Al Qaeda , but the warnings were ignored .\nAgents in Minneapolis frantically sought approval for a search warrant to search the laptop of Zaccarias Moussaoui , a suspected terrorist who had been receiving flight training in the area .\nWhen that request was denied , one exasperated agent told FBI headquarters that he was “ trying to keep someone from taking a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Rita Flack , an intelligence opearations specialist at headquarters who had read the Phoenix memo , failed to pass that info on to any of her colleagues involved in the decision to deny the warrant to search Moussaoi ’ s laptop .\nFBI whistleblower Colleen Rowley later revealed that agents in the Minneapolis office—desperately trying to find an answer to the question of why the Bureau was deliberately sabotaging the case—faced the problem with gallows humour : “ I know I shouldn ’ t be flippant about this , but jokes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be spies or moles , like Robert Hansen , who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis ’ effort.\n” The Pentagon ’ s intelligence branch , meanwhile , not only had foreknowledge of the plot , but—according to information that emerged years later and was quickly suppressed—had identified four of the presumed terror operatives and mapped out the network connecting them to the Brooklyn cell headed by the Blind Sheikh .\n“ Able Danger ” was a classified information operations campaign against transnational terrorism launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 .\nFirst revealed to the public in June 2005 , Able Danger employed data mining techniques on open source and classified information to identify networks of likely terror agents , including those operating in the US .\nThe program was remarkably successful : not only did it warn the Pentagon of an impending attack just days before the Cole bombing , as we have already seen , but , according to Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) whistleblower Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and four of his colleagues working on the operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells connecting Al Qaeda to the alleged hijackers .\nIt even identified four of those suspects—including Mohamed Atta—by name .\nWhen Lt. Col. Shaffer tried to set up a meeting between his supervisor and FBI officials in Washington to discuss a collaborative approach to tracking these cells , he was rebuffed by lawyers for the Pentagon ’ s Special Operations Command .\nShortly thereafter , Shaffer was ordered off the Able Danger team and the unit was disbanded , with the Pentagon ordering all the Able Danger data—2.5 terabytes worth of information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed material in the Library of Congress—destroyed .\nAfter a hostile investigation that left witnesses feeling intimidated into changing their story about Able Danger still found five Pentagon employees who said they had seen the organizational chart with Atta ’ s name on it , the Department of Defense Inspector General concluded that Able Danger had never identified Atta or any other alleged hijacker .\nAnd , just two months after the story became public—including Shaffer ’ s revelation that he had met with 9/11 Commission Executive Director Philip Zelikow and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an extensive hour-long debriefing in Afghanistan that did not find its way into the Commission ’ s final report—the DIA stripped Shaffer of his security clearance , essentially ending his decades-long career as a military intelligence officer .\nThe NSA , meanwhile—despite the “ scrambler and fiber optics ” excuses of the agency ’ s apologists—were monitoring all of the communications going through Al Qaeda ’ s pivotal Yemen communications hub from the lead-up to the Embassy bombings straight through to the execution of 9/11 itself .\nThis “ communications hub ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping into and transcribing the satellite phone calls of Bin Laden—was , in fact , the home of Ahmed al-Hada , one of the jihadis who had fought alongside Bin Laden against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s .\nHada ’ s phone was used by various Al Qaeda-linked operatives to pass messages to each other , as some countries blocked or monitored calls to other countries as possible terrorist communications .\nThe NSA listened as Mohamed al-Owhali , one of the bombers involved in the embassy attack , made multiple calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack .\nThey listened as Al Qaeda operatives called the hub to discuss attacking a US warship in the months prior to the Cole bombing .\nAnd they listened as numerous terror suspects called to discuss their operations with Khalid al-Mihdhar , one of the alleged 9/11 hijackers and the son-in-law of Ahmed al-Hada .\nThomas Drake was a decorated United States Air Force and United States Navy veteran with a background in military crypto-electronics who had worked for twelve years as an outside contractor at the NSA .\n9/11 was his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , and it was in the wake of that attack that he was handed a report from one of his colleagues in the NSA ’ s “ CounterTerror Shop ” that laid out the agency ’ s role in the events of that day .\nAccording to Drake , the report was “ an extraordinarily detailed long-term study of Al Qaeda ’ s activities ” that identified “ the planning cells ” for 9/11 , including “ a number of the hijackers based on actual copy : Atta , Hazmi , Mihdhar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the NSA ’ s radar by the start of 2001 .\nIt also contained specific warnings about 9/11 .\nDrake immediately gave the document to his supervisor , Maureen Baginski , who told him : “ Tom , I wish you had not brought this to my attention.\n” He was subsequently forced out of his position , stripped of his security clearance and indicted under the Espionage Act .\nOn the day of the attacks , knowing the information that the NSA had that could have foiled the plot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffers suffered heart attacks , with one dying .\nAnother , a female analyst who had been responsible for monitoring the Yemen hub communications , left NSA headquarters after suffering what Drake was told was a nervous breakdown .\nYet another , a 40-something man , began openly crying in a hallway , telling three women he was talking to in full view of everyone passing : “ We knew this was being planned months ago , but they would not let us issue the reports we wrote.\n” NSA leadership , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the SIGINT division , Maureen Baginski , had a different reaction to the events unfolding that morning .\nIn fact , the story of intelligence agency foreknowledge of the plot goes from the merely impossible to the outright absurd when it is revealed that it wasn ’ t just US intelligence that had a window into the plot , but every major intelligence service in the world .\nIn subsequent years , it has emerged that intelligence agencies in Indonesia , the UK , Germany , Italy , Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , Israel had all passed on various warnings about an imminent attack in the months and years leading up to 9/11 .\nAnd , infamously , the President received a classified intelligence briefing on August 6 , 2001 , that unequivocally stated that an attack was being prepared .\nIt ’ s no surprise that this plot—the most important ever attempted by Al Qaeda—would have been known by so many .\nNot only did the men that ( we are told ) bin Laden hand-picked for the operation make no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , they instead—in the words of some investigators—left a deliberate trail behind them , a trail that was picked up and extensively reported on in the immediate wake of the attacks .\nPerhaps the greatest clue as to the real nature of the 9/11 operation , however , is found in one of the most stunning pieces of evidence of direct intelligence agency complicity in the plot .\nIn the years after the attack , it was revealed that the CIA were not just surveilling the supposed hijackers or gathering information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these men ’ s travels from reaching other intelligence agencies , deliberately hiding the fact that two of these agents had entered the US and were openly living in the country from the FBI and even from the National Security Council itself for over one and a half years .\nThis incredible fact , buried in footnote 44 of chapter 6 of the 9/11 Commission report , was no trivial detail .\n9/11 Commission chair Thomas Kean called it “ one of the most troubling aspects of our entire report.\n” White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evidence of both CIA malfeasance and misfeasance .\nAnd Mark Rossini , an FBI agent assigned to the CIA ’ s Bin Laden unit , believed it to be part of a secret intelligence operation involving these supposed terrorist hijackers that the agency didn ’ t want anyone to discover .\nShortly after the Cole bombing , Fahad al-Quso , a Yemeni with known links to Osama Bin Laden , was interrogated by Yemeni agents and admitted that he had flown from Yemen to Bangkok the previous January to deliver $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrorist based in Malaysia who Quso identified as the bombing mastermind .\nThe money , Quso said , was to buy this one-legged terror mastermind an artificial leg .\nBut Ali Soufan—the head of the FBI investigation into the Cole bombing—was puzzled by this lead .\nWhy was Al Qaeda transferring money out of Yemen when they were supposedly planning an attack in that country ?\nWas this money for a different operation ?\nAs with every such lead , Soufan followed up with an official request to the CIA for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Malaysia or the phone number that Quso had used to contact him there .\nThe CIA never responded to any of these official requests .\nOn December 29 , 1999—with all of the US intelligence services on heightened alert due to the threat of millennium terror attacks—the NSA shares information from their wiretap of Al Qaeda ’ s Yemen communications hub with the CIA : Khalid Al-Mihdhar , Nawaf Alhazmi , and Salem Alhazmi will be flying to Malaysia to attend an important Al Qaeda summit the following month .\nThe CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to the Yemen communications hub , tasks agents from eight CIA offices and six friendly foreign intelligence services with tracking his travel to Malaysia .\nThe surveillance operation is successful .\nWhen Al-Mihdhar changes planes in Dubai , the CIA obtains a copy of his passport .\nInside is a vital piece of information : this known bin Laden associate , on his way to an Al Qaeda summit , has a visa to enter the United States .\nA visa that was issued at the same Jeddah consulate where , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure visas for Osama bin Laden ’ s men during the Afghan-Soviet war .\nSeasoned intelligence officials have no trouble understanding the importance of this fact .\nReflecting on the incredible nature of this series of events years later , veteran FBI agent Jack Cloonan remarked : “ How often do you get into someone ’ s suitcase and find multiple-entry visas ?\nAnd how often do you know there ’ s going to be an organizational meeting of Al Qaeda any place in the world ?\nThe chances are slim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets .\nIt ’ s a home run in the ninth inning of the World Series .\nThis is the kind of case you hope your whole life for.\n” What happened next is so inexplicable for purveyors of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory that it is typically never discussed .\nAfter scoring this once-in-a-lifetime intelligence coup—this “ home run in the ninth inning of the World Series ” —the CIA then failed to watchlist either Al-Mihdhar or Alhazmi , allegedly lost track of them after they went on from Malaysia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel where they stayed in Bangkok ) and failed to inform FBI investigators like Ali Soufan that these known terror associates had been tracked to an Al Qaeda summit .\nMost incredibly of all , the official record shows that supervisors in the CIA ’ s Bin Laden unit repeatedly and deliberately stopped agents from sending info about Al-Mihdhar ’ s US visa to the FBI .\nOn January 5th , 2000 , while the summit was still underway in Kuala Lumpur , the CIA ’ s Riyadh station forwarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec station at Langley .\nDoug Miller—an FBI officer assigned to the Bin Laden unit as part of an intelligence sharing program between the CIA and the FBI—read the cable and , following protocol , immediately drafted a memo asking for permission to forward the info to FBI headquarters .\nThe reply from his CIA supervisor , Michael Anne Casey , citing Alex station ’ s deputy chief , Tom Wilshere , was immediate and unequivocal : “ This is not a matter for the FBI.\n” Thus began an 18-month odyssey in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and not one of them ever officially shared it with any FBI or National Security Council official , even then-counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke .\nOn its own , this is scarcely believable .\nThe Central Intelligence Agency actively and deliberately made a decision to stop the automatic sharing of information on the most sensitive national security intelligence in their possession .\nOn September 12 , 2001 , when the CIA finally granted Ali Soufan ’ s request from nearly one year before and sent him their intelligence about the Malaysia meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , vomiting on the floor next to the toilet .\nWhen one of his colleagues asked him what had happened , he said : “ They knew , they knew.\n” But neither Soufan nor anyone else familiar with the hidden history of Al Qaeda should be surprised .\nWhen put into its context , this episode is a perfectly predictable continuation of the same pattern of intelligence agency aid that , as we have seen , defines the story of Al Qaeda .\nIt is sometimes said that in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence agencies have to get everything right all the time whereas the terrorists only have to get lucky once .\nBut the Al Qaeda “ terrorists ” —protected , shepherded and aided by the intelligence agencies as they demonstrably were—did not get lucky once .\nThey got lucky over and over and over again , time after time after time , year after year after year from their earliest beginnings through their development and growth , through their rise to international prominence , through every major terrorist attack of the 1990s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt this point , the “ incompetence ” theory of “ failures ” and “ missed opportunities ” is not only not supportable , it is a transparent falsehood .\nThere is only one conclusion possible : These “ terrorists ” were deliberately aided .\nThis is not fringe conspiracy thinking .\nEven Richard Clarke eventually came to this conclusion .\nThat the former top-ranking counterterrorism official in the United States has publicly accused the former director of the CIA and other top CIA officials of running an operation involving the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation and information about it up to and through 9/11—an incredible accusation recorded by two independent filmmakers and freely viewable on YouTube for the past decade—is apparently of so little importance that it has never been followed up on by any major media outlet .\nBut Clarke ’ s version of the story , explosive as it is—that these accused terrorists really were terrorists , that they , like Ali Mohamed , managed to triple cross the intelligence agencies that were trying to use them as double agents against Al Qaeda , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies up to and including the director of the CIA engaged in a cover up of the entire affair , indirectly allowing 9/11 to take place purely to save their own skin—demonstrably can not be the full story .\nAs we now know , these nineteen men were no devout Islamic fundamentalists driven by their devotion into striking against the infidels .\nThese alcohol-drinking , strip club-attending bumblers who , at one point , lived with an FBI informant and who left what investigators described as a deliberate trail behind them were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA .\nThey did not coordinate their plan to coincide precisely with the live fly highjacking exercises , military war games and planes-into-buildings training drills that were taking place on the day of 9/11 .\nThey did not overpower the military-trained pilots on four separate planes before a single one of them could so much as send out a hijack signal .\nThey did not know to commit those hijackings precisely in the highly-classified radar gaps that made their planes ’ movements opaque to flight traffic controllers .\nThey did not pilot those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called “ tough for any airline pilot ” despite never having sat in the cockpit of a jumbo jet before .\nThey did not cause three buildings to pulverize themselves in mid-air , falling directly through the path of most resistance at freefall gravitational acceleration with two planes .\nThey did not decide to fly around the Pentagon to miss the Defense Secretary ’ s office and instead hit the section of the building where bookkeepers and budget analysts were working on the problem of the $ 2.3 trillion that Donald Rumsfeld had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accounted for in the Defence Department ’ s budget .\nThey did not commit the informed trading that three separate academic studies have proven did take place in the run up to 9/11 .\nThey did not engage in the decades-long cover up of these facts in the wake of that attack .\nAnd they did not launch the war of terror that sometimes saw the US and its allies using Al Qaeda as a convenient excuse for aggression in foreign countries and other times saw them actively collaborating with Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRichard Clarke ’ s story is itself a cover up .\nThe spectacular , catalyzing terror attack of 9/11 was not allowed to happen .\nIt was made to happen .\nBut why ?\nWho , other than the devout Muslim suicide warriors posited by the official 9/11 conspiracy theorists , would do such a thing ?\nAnd for what purpose ?\nTo answer these questions , we need to return to Operation Susannah and the false flag terror ruse that has been employed by the British , the Israelis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall see , just eight years after Operation Susannah failed in Egypt , the highest-ranking officials in the US military drafted plans to stage terror attacks , blow up airliners and even kill Americans in order to blame their political enemies .\nAnd in the lead up to 9/11 a cadre of political operatives brought those plans into the 21st century , paving the way for a new Pearl Harbor that would begin a worldwide war of terror and a clash of civilizations .\nVisit James Corbett at CorbettReport.com .\nSubscribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patron !\nOr support us at SubscribeStar Donate cryptocurrency HERE Subscribe to

, he was the right-hand man to his musical best friend , Youtha Anthony Fowler , who many hip hop and R & B heads know as DJ Nabs .\nBut rather than jet-setting with Fowler , Lucas discovered drugs and the drug trade at the height of the so-called war on drugs .\nAddicted to crack cocaine and involved in trafficking the drug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the drug abuse and violence plaguing major cities and working class Black communities were not seen as the public health issue that opioids are today .\nBy chance , Lucas received a rare bit of mercy .\nHe got the kind of help that many Black and

given to their ability to rehabilitate .\nIn addition to being denied employment , those with criminal records can be limited in their access to business and educational loans , housing , child custody rights , voting rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that was born when Lucas was barely out of diapers .\nFifty years ago this summer , President Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs .\nToday , with the U.S. mired in a deadly opioid epidemic that did not abate during the coronavirus pandemic ’ s worst days , it is questionable whether anyone won the war .\nYet the loser is clear : Black and Latino Americans , their families and their communities .\nA key weapon was the imposition of mandatory minimums in prison sentencing .\nDecades later those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the prison industrial complex that saw millions of people , primarily of color , locked up and shut out of the American dream .\nAn Associated Press review of federal and state incarceration data shows that , between 1975 and 2019 , the U.S. prison population jumped from 240,593 to 1.43 million Americans .\nAmong them , about 1 in 5 people were incarcerated with a drug offense listed as their most serious

         "NBC contributor Noah Berlatsky is now the Communications Director for Prostasia , a not-for-profit group that is reportedly attempting to legitimize pedophilia under the guise of helping children .\nAs part of his work with the group , he has written about legitimizing `` trans children , '' conducted interviews about the positive impact of pornography on children , and how the best way to help children who are trafficked into the sex trade is to `` decriminalize the sex industry . ''\nProstasia offers pedophiles a MAP Support Club , which `` is a peer support chat for minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual abuse and committed to never harm children , and is a safe space to have peer support in times of trouble . ''\nThis group is for people who are aged 13 and up .\nProstasia bills itself as `` a new kind of child protection organization '' that has a different approach to protecting children than the current methods of social work and law enforcement , saying that these approaches `` are less effective than they should be , because they are driven by emotion rather than evidence . ''\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are self-identified pedophiles .\nThe idea is that with support , these `` minor attracted persons '' can be `` committed to never offending . ''\nTimothy N. Fury , writing for Prostasia , says that for pedophiles , '' The most common struggle is not with child sexual abuse images , '' and that many of these people are looking `` for recommendations on where to get professional help . ''\nWhile Fury writes that `` Some minor-attracted people do struggle with viewing sexually harmful images , and they are provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for Fury , this is personal ; `` ... these people are not the majority of us , '' he writes .\n`` No , the majority of us struggle with basic mental health issues—some diagnosed , some not—and just need a place to talk about things they feel they can never talk to friends and family members about .\nMany of these minor attracted people are children themselves . ''\nFury 's piece is just one in defense of pedophilia as a predilection .\nBerlatsky promotes the work of UC Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people who trade sex do n't see themselves as victims , Lutnick emphasizes .\nThey often see themselves as resourceful individuals who are doing what they need to survive in difficult circumstances . ''\nBerlatsky writes for Prostasia that there 's an issue with the term `` trafficking '' itself , saying that it `` conflates underage people trading sex , consensual sex work , immigration , and all kinds of labor exploitation in all industries . ''\nHe claims that to use the word trafficking for child sex trafficking is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to target sex workers rather than labor exploitation . ''\nShe uncovered a tweet from Dr. James Cantor , part of the Prostasia team , who advocates for the idea that pedophilia is an innate condition , in which he said that pedophiles should be included in the LGBT identity alphabet .\nCantor wrote : `` Speaking as a gay man , I believe we SHOULD include the P. To do otherwise is to betray the principles that give us our rights . ''\nFor Cantor , pedophilia is just another kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing policies to protect children from sexual abuse does more harm than good .\nThey say that they undertake to `` reduce the separate harms caused to children and others by our society 's predominantly reactive child protection agenda . ''\nAs for `` Sex worker rights , '' Prostasia states that they are `` strongly opposed to minors engaging in any kind of sex work , '' but they have concerns that measure to combat child sex trafficking `` target all sex workers in the name of protecting those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportionate and infringe the rights of adult sex workers . ''\nBerlatsky seems to see little difference between sex work and other kinds of work , saying that the `` lots of jobs require people to barter their health and their bodies , '' and comparing sex workers to people who work in mines .\nHe calls children who have been trafficked into the sex trade `` young people trading in sex , '' and believes that the key way to help them is to deal with the root causes that led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the crime of sex trafficking itself ."

''\n`` It 's not just about the sample , it 's about the geologic context of that sample that will also be explored , '' Thomas Zurbuchen , NASA 's director of science operations , said in a news conference Wednesday .\nPerseverance will obtain samples using a drill bit , which cuts cylindrical cores into the Martian surface , over the course of about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-sectional view of the layers and other features of the rock .\nThe rover will recover about 40 cores from the ground , each weighing about a half an ounce , or about the size of a piece of chalk .\nIt will triple-seal them into sample tubes to keep them in pristine condition .\nAnd the next step is something a bit unusual : It will set them down on the Martian surface , and leave them there .\n`` After we drill them , we do something that seems crazy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call a cache , '' Farley said .\n`` In the next two parts of the program , we go get them and bring them back . ''\nIn either 2026 or 2028 , NASA will launch a Sample Retrieval Lander to Mars , in partnership with the European Space Agency .\nIt will be carrying both a rover and a rocket , known as the Mars Ascent Vehicle .\nAfter it lands at Jezero in 2028 , the `` Martian dune buggy '' will speed across the surface , retrieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load them into the rocket .\nOnce sealed , the rocket will prepare for the first launch ever attempted from another planet .\nThe rocket will take off from the surface of Mars and drop a container about the size of a basketball , containing the samples , into orbit around the red planet .\n`` Much like the baton in a relay race , this container is the heart of sample return , '' Bobby Braun , director for planetary science at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , explained in a news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacecraft will also make the long journey to Mars ' orbit .\nThe massive Earth Return Orbiter , which is as large as an airplane , will rendezvous with and capture the cache of rock samples orbiting the planet and then return to Earth , hopefully in 2031 .\n`` If it sounds complicated , it is , '' Glaze said .\n`` If it sounds extreme , it most certainly is .

we share online , we are making it that much easier for the government and its corporate partners to identify , track and eventually round us up .\nSaint or sinner , it doesn ’ t matter because we ’ re all being swept up into a massive digital data dragnet that does not distinguish between those who are innocent of wrongdoing , suspects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to live in a suspect society .\nThe government ’ s efforts to round up those who took part in the Capitol riots shows exactly how vulnerable we all are to the menace of a surveillance state that aspires to a God-like awareness of our lives .\nRelying on selfies , social media posts , location data , geotagged photos , facial recognition , surveillance cameras and crowdsourcing , government agents are compiling a massive data trove on anyone and everyone who may have been anywhere in the vicinity of the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of digital information is staggering : 15,000 hours of surveillance and body-worn camera footage ; 1,600 electronic devices ; 270,000 digital media tips ; at least 140,000 photos and videos ; and about 100,000 location pings for thousands of smartphones .\nAnd that ’ s just what we know .\nMore than 300 individuals from 40 states have already been charged and another 280 arrested in connection with the events of January 6 .\nAs many as 500 others are still being hunted by government agents .\nAlso included in this data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with the riots but whose cell phone location data identified them as being in the wrong place at the wrong time .\nForget about being innocent until proven guilty .\nIn a suspect society such as ours , the burden of proof has been flipped : now , you start off guilty and have to prove your innocence .\nThe Ultimate Privacy Phone and Laptop from Purism ( Ad ) For instance , you didn ’ t even have to be involved in the Capitol riots to qualify for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly been tracking—and questioning—anyone whose cell phones connected to WiFi or pinged cell phone towers near the Capitol .\nOne man , who had gone out for a walk with his daughters only to end up stranded near the Capitol crowds , actually had FBI agents show up at his door days later .\nUsing Google Maps , agents were able to pinpoint exactly where they were standing and for how long .\nAll of the many creepy , calculating , invasive investigative and surveillance tools the government has acquired over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI ’ s ongoing efforts to bring the rioters to “ justice.\n” FBI agents are matching photos with drivers ’ license pictures ; tracking movements by way of license plate toll readers ; and zooming in on physical identifying marks such as moles , scars and tattoos , as well as brands , logos and symbols on clothing and backpacks .\nThey ’ re poring over hours of security and body camera footage ; scouring social media posts ; triangulating data from cellphone towers and WiFi signals ; layering facial recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cross-referencing footage with public social media posts .\nIt ’ s not just the FBI on the hunt , however .\nThey ’ ve enlisted the help of volunteer posses of private citizens , such as Deep State Dogs , to collaborate on the grunt work .\nAs Dinah Voyles Pulver reports , once Deep State Dogs locates a person and confirms their identity , they put a package together with the person ’ s name , address , phone number and several images and send it to the FBI .\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on the American public and volunteer cybersleuths to help bolster its cases .\nThis takes See Something , Say Something snitching programs to a whole new level .\nThe lesson to be learned : Big Brother , Big Sister and all of their friends are watching you .\nActivist Post Recommended Book : Snitch Culture : How Citizens Are Turned Into The Eyes And Ears Of The State They see your every move : what you read , how much you spend , where you go , with whom you interact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what you ’ re watching on television and reading on the internet .\nEvery move you make is being monitored , mined for data , crunched , and tabulated in order to form a picture of who you are , what makes you tick , and how best to control you when and if it becomes necessary to bring you in line .\nSimply liking or sharing this article on Facebook , retweeting it on Twitter , or merely reading it or any other articles related to government wrongdoing , surveillance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to get you categorized as a particular kind of person with particular kinds of interests that reflect a particular kind of mindset that might just lead you to engage in a particular kinds of activities and , therefore , puts you in the crosshairs of a government investigation as a potential troublemaker a.k.a .\ndomestic extremist .\nChances are , as the Washington Post reports , you have already been assigned a color-coded threat score—green , yellow or red—so police are forewarned about your potential inclination to be a troublemaker depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the military , posted a comment perceived as threatening on Facebook , suffer from a particular medical condition , or know someone who knows someone who might have committed a crime .\nIn other words , you might already be flagged as potentially anti-government in a government database somewhere—Main Core , for example—that identifies and tracks individuals who aren ’ t inclined to march in lockstep to the police state ’ s dictates .\nThe government has the know-how .\nIt took days , if not hours or minutes , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tracking and rounding up those suspected of being part of the Capitol riots .\nImagine how quickly government agents could target and round up any segment of society they wanted to based on the digital trails and digital footprints we leave behind .\nOf course , the government has been hard at work for years acquiring these totalitarian powers .\nLong before the January 6 riots , the FBI was busily amassing the surveillance tools necessary to monitor social media posts , track and identify individuals using cell phone signals and facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects ” who may be of interest to the government for one reason or another .\nAs The Intercept reported , the FBI , CIA , NSA and other government agencies have increasingly invested in corporate surveillance technologies that can mine constitutionally protected speech on social media platforms such as Facebook , Twitter and Instagram in order to identify potential extremists and predict who might engage in future acts of anti-government behavior .\nAll it needs is the data , which more than 90 % of young adults and 65 % of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government sees all and knows all and has an abundance of laws to render even the most seemingly upstanding citizen a criminal and lawbreaker , then the old adage that you ’ ve got nothing to worry about if you ’ ve got nothing to hide no longer applies .\nAs for the Fourth Amendment and its prohibitions on warrantless searches and invasions of privacy without probable cause , those safeguards have been rendered all but useless by legislative end-runs , judicial justifications , and corporate collusions .\nWe now find ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , managed and controlled by our technology , which answers not to us but to our government and corporate rulers .\nConsider that on any given day , the average American going about his daily business will be monitored , surveilled , spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways , by both government and corporate eyes and ears .\nA byproduct of this new age in which we live , whether you ’ re walking through a store , driving your car , checking email , or talking to friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be sure that some government agency , whether the NSA or some other entity , is listening in and tracking your behavior .\nThis doesn ’ t even begin to touch on the corporate trackers that monitor your purchases , web browsing , social media posts and other activities taking place in the cyber sphere .\nFor example , police have been using Stingray devices mounted on their cruisers to intercept cell phone calls and text messages without court-issued search warrants .\nDoppler radar devices , which can detect human breathing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being employed by the police to deliver arrest warrants .\nLicense plate readers , yet another law enforcement spying device made possible through funding by the Department of Homeland Security , can record up to 1800 license plates per minute .\nMoreover , these surveillance cameras can also photograph those inside a moving car .\nReports indicate that the Drug Enforcement Administration has been using the cameras in conjunction with facial recognition software to build a “ vehicle surveillance database ” of the nation ’ s cars , drivers and passengers .\nSidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold to gullible communities as a sure-fire means of fighting crime , is yet another DHS program that is blanketing small and large towns alike with government-funded and monitored surveillance cameras .\nIt ’ s all part of a public-private partnership that gives government officials access to all manner of surveillance cameras , on sidewalks , on buildings , on buses , even those installed on private property .\nCouple these surveillance cameras with facial recognition and behavior-sensing technology and you have the makings of “ pre-crime ” cameras , which scan your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for “ normal ” behavior , and alert the police if you trigger any computerized alarms as being “ suspicious.\n” State and federal law enforcement agencies are pushing to expand their biometric and DNA databases by requiring that anyone accused of a misdemeanor have their DNA collected and catalogued .\nHowever , technology is already available that allows the government to collect biometrics such as fingerprints from a distance , without a person ’ s cooperation or knowledge .\nOne system can actually scan and identify a fingerprint from nearly 20 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a radar gun that can actually show if you or someone in your car is texting .\nAnother technology being developed , dubbed a “ textalyzer ” device , would allow police to determine whether someone was driving while distracted .\nRefusing to submit one ’ s phone to testing could result in a suspended or revoked driver ’ s license .\nIt ’ s a sure bet that anything the government welcomes ( and funds ) too enthusiastically is bound to be a Trojan horse full of nasty , invasive surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras .\nHailed as the easy fix solution to police abuses , these body cameras—made possible by funding from the Department of Justice—turn police officers into roving surveillance cameras .\nOf course , if you try to request access to that footage , you ’ ll find yourself being led a merry and costly chase through miles of red tape , bureaucratic footmen and unhelpful courts .\nThe “ internet of things ” refers to the growing number of “ smart ” appliances and electronic devices now connected to the internet and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled remotely .\nThese range from thermostats and coffee makers to cars and TVs .\nOf course , there ’ s a price to pay for such easy control and access .\nThat price amounts to relinquishing ultimate control of and access to your home to the government and its corporate partners .\nFor example , while Samsung ’ s Smart TVs are capable of “ listening ” to what you say , thereby allowing users to control the TV using voice commands , it also records everything you say and relays it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government .\nThen again , the government doesn ’ t really need to spy on you using your smart TV when the FBI can remotely activate the microphone on your cellphone and record your conversations .\nThe FBI can also do the same thing to laptop computers without the owner knowing any better .\nDrones , which are taking to the skies en masse , are the converging point for all of the weapons and technology already available to law enforcement agencies .\nIn fact , drones can listen in on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your home , scan your biometrics , photograph you and track your movements , and even corral you with sophisticated weaponry .\nAll of these technologies add up to a society in which there ’ s little room for indiscretions , imperfections , or acts of independence , especially not when the government can listen in on your phone calls , monitor your driving habits , track your movements , scrutinize your purchases and peer through the walls of your home .\nThese digital trails are everywhere .\nAs investigative journalists Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ This data—collected by smartphone apps and then fed into a dizzyingly complex digital advertising ecosystem … provided an intimate record of people whether they were visiting drug treatment centers , strip clubs , casinos , abortion clinics or places of worship.\n” In such a surveillance ecosystem , we ’ re all suspects and databits to be tracked , catalogued and targeted .\nAs I point out in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People , this is the creepy , calculating yet diabolical genius of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed as revolutionary and liberating has become our prison , jailer , probation officer , Big Brother and Father Knows Best all rolled into one .\nThere is no gray area any longer ."

         "Mark Finchem cleared of 82 ethics complaints related to the Jan. 6 riot",
         "Oro Valley Republican Mark Finchem has been cleared of 82 ethics complaints that were filed against him after he was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and praised the rioters who stormed the building and disrupted Congress in the deadly siege .\nHouse Ethics Committee Chairwoman Becky Nutt on Friday released a letter saying the committee would take no action on the complaints , which have centered around Finchem ’ s involvement in the rally-turned-coup attempt .\nNutt ’ s decision was first reported by 12 News .\nFinchem was at the Capitol when Trump supporters engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certifying Joe Biden ’ s election victory that left five people dead , including a Capitol police officer .\nOn his Twitter page , Finchem posted a photo he took of the Capitol after rioters and protesters had breached the inner areas of the Capitol grounds .\n“ What happens when the People feel they have been ignored , and Congress refuses to acknowledge rampant fraud , ” he wrote , praising the rioters .\nFinchem has since deleted his Twitter account .\nState Rep. César Chávez , D-Phoenix , filed an ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it showed Finchem participated in the insurrection .\nIn the following four weeks , the committee received 81 more complaints .\n“ Most were notarized , but the vast majority appeared to be form letters , ” Nutt wrote .\n“ More to the point , none of the complaints offered any facts establishing that Representative Finchem actually ‘ supported the violent overthrow of our government ’ or directly participated in the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol.\n” The letter goes on to say that the complaints amount to “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy of controversial political opinions.\n” Finchem has been on the forefront of the controversial # StopTheSteal movement , as the Arizona Mirror previously reported .\nAli Alexander , a # StopTheSteal organizer has said that “ Arizona started with one man : State Representative Mark Finchem.\n” Complaints made about Finchem apparently also wrapped in other lawmakers .\nRep. Bret Roberts , R-Maricopa , was mentioned in a complaint in which a constituent said that comments he made about the 2020 election aimed to disenfranchise voters and that he engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were true , it too would amount to controversial political advocacy , which falls outside this committee ’ s purview , ” Nutt wrote in her dismissal letter .\nIn Finchem ’ s very first tweet using “ # StopTheSteal , ” he also used the hashtag “ # bretroberts , ” according to a download of Finchem ’ s tweets obtained by the Mirror .\n“ AZ Legislature must be called back into special session to hold a hearing , take evidence and make a decision on whether fraud corrupted our 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 1 plenary duty to act .\n# stopthesteal # bretroberts , ” the Nov. 19 tweet says .\nNutt also mentioned a complaint that claimed Reps. David Cook and Walt Blackman , Republicans from Globe and Snowflake , respectively , were present in Washington D.C .\nBoth lawmakers told Nutt saying they were not , she wrote .\n“ I therefore conclude that none of these complaints warrants any action at this time , ” the letter says .\nDemocratic lawmakers in the Arizona legislature are currently trying to expel Finchem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurrection at the U.S. Capitol , his ties to extremist groups and for spreading misinformation about the election ."

         "NSA opens doors to new \"collaboration center\" as cyberthreats mount",
         "Fort Meade , Maryland — One of the most notoriously secretive U.S. intelligence agencies has opened a new facility that it hopes , uncharacteristically , will welcome plenty of outside visitors .\nWhile most of the National Security Agency 's ( NSA ) outposts are closed-off , highly restricted spaces , the agency 's newly launched Cybersecurity Collaboration Center , located a few miles outside its main campus in Fort Meade , Maryland , is meant to serve as a gathering point for government and private sector cybersecurity experts to exchange information about hacking threats from adversaries in real time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press , who were invited to visit the space on Tuesday — comes as massive cyber incursions and multiple ransomware attacks have roiled U.S. government agencies and private sector companies , and amid an admonition from the NSA that it ca n't effectively protect what it ca n't see : vulnerabilities in domestic networks .\nGeneral Paul Nakasone , who leads both the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command , has said repeatedly in appearances before Congress that the two organizations , which are authorized to operate outside of the U.S. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited by U.S. laws and policies in what they can observe internally .\n`` It 's not the fact that we ca n't connect the dots .\nWe ca n't see all of the dots , '' Nakasone said in public testimony in March .\nAdversaries `` understand that they can come into the United States , use our infrastructure , and there 's a blind spot for us not being able to see them . ''\n`` Being able to identify and being able to fix those areas are part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be addressed , '' he said .\nThe 36,000-square-foot Cybersecurity Collaboration Center , run by the NSA 's recently restructured Cybersecurity Directorate , is designed to be at least part of the fix .\nThe agency has invited cybersecurity experts from a range of industries to sit side by side with agency analysts , share what they see on their computer networks and thereby help hone the tradecraft needed to identify and counter foreign cyberthreats .\n`` [ I ] f we 're able to combine our insights with what they 're seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a better comprehensive picture of what the adversary is doing , '' said Morgan Adamski , the chief of the center .\nShe declined to name any of the partner companies or offer details on the number of relationships the NSA had established to date .\nWhile the building itself is an unremarkable exemplar of industrial flex office space , it stands worlds apart from other NSA facilities by virtue of having Wi-Fi , open work areas and lots of windows .\nThere are some classified spaces available for partners with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also elements of flair that are uncharacteristic of the NSA .\nThere is modular furniture .\nColumns are emblazoned with one-word slogans like `` Transform '' and `` Imagine . ''\nThere are cushy chairs upholstered in a vibrant persimmon .\n`` You will notice it is not the custom 'NSA beige ' color , '' Adamski said .\n`` What we wanted to do was ensure that our space felt like the cybersecurity industry that we 're partnering with . ''\nThough it had n't yet opened physically , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adamski said , involved the NSA 's disclosure in January of 2020 of a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 10 .\nIt was also behind a subsequent public disclosure , in April , of a series of vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange email app .\nThe disclosures were notable for how far of a departure they were from how the NSA was used to operating .\nIn the past , the agency likely would have kept any software vulnerabilities it came across to itself , for possible use as tools to spy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the exponential growth in cyber threats and the need to partner with the private sector have meant transparency — once an anathematic notion — would need to become the norm .\n`` It 's clear that things have to change , '' said Rob Joyce , a career cybersecurity official who now leads the NSA 's Cybersecurity Directorate .\n`` The ransomware issue has hit the general population and cyber threats have spilled over from the digital realm into the physical realm , and all of us , as a consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or drove by gas stations without fuel , '' Joyce said , referencing the attack , attributed to Russian cyber criminals , on Colonial Pipeline last month .\n`` It is the culmination of the recognition that we 've had for years that the things we 're attaching to the Internet that control things in the physical world bring vulnerabilities . ''\n`` So as that threat evolves , we have to evolve , '' he said .\nJoyce , who succeeded Anne Neuberger , now the deputy national security adviser for cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council , said the NSA was also drawing increasingly on its foreign partnerships , including the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance , for insights into how malign actors are operating .\n`` What we 're finding is all our allies , whether it 's across NATO or more broadly , have these same cybersecurity threats and they want to work with us , and one of the most common areas of desire for collaboration is on cybersecurity , '' Joyce said .\n`` So we 're pushing at an open door with foreign partnerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and European Union pledged to deepen existing cybersecurity information exchanges .\nAnd notably , President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin — whose government has been known to launch cyberattacks , engage in cyber espionage and to countenance the operations of criminal groups operating on Russian soil — said following a summit last week that they had agreed to start `` consultations '' on cybersecurity matters .\nJoyce said the NSA would inform , but was unlikely to participate in , any talks with Moscow .\n`` I would not expect NSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions of cybersecurity .\nThere [ are ] other entities in the government that are going to do that international policy , '' Joyce said .\n`` But we will absolutely use our threat-informed mission and NSA 's reporting to inform those policymakers , and others in the executive branch who would lead negotiations and engagement .

         "Donald Trump 's coup attempt — and especially the Jan. 6 attack he incited on the U.S. Capitol — were a type of `` white riot '' and insurrection against multiracial democracy .\nSociologist Bart Bonikowski recently offered this analysis to Thomas Edsall of the New York Times : The lethal violence by Trump 's followers at the Capitol was not the end but rather another stage of escalation in right-wing extremism and terrorism against multiracial democracy .\nLaw enforcement officials and counter-insurgency experts are warning that the United States will likely experience an increasing amount of white supremacist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence in response to the country 's changing racial demographics .\nThe symbolic power of Joe Biden 's presidency , and especially of Kamala Harris , the first woman , first Black person and first Asian American to serve as vice president , will only fuel more right-wing terrorism and other violence .\nTrump 's neofascist movement has given permission for such violence , and has provided a space for radicalization into political extremism as well as the material and other resources to sustain an armed insurrection against American democracy .\nTrump has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` shadow president '' commanding this movement through stochastic terrorism .\nIn total , the power of Donald Trump 's appeals to white supremacy , racial authoritarianism , white victimhood and white violence were so powerful for his voters and other followers that despite a ruined economy and a pandemic that has already killed more than 440,000 people in the United States , Trump received millions more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016 .\nThe rise of Trumpism and its enduring appeal for tens of millions of white Americans also reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other researchers : Many people in that population feel a growing sense of alienation and loneliness as well as feelings of obsolescence and declining social value .\nThis gives rise to widespread resentment , a disregard for death ( and in some cases a literal death wish ) and an increasing attraction to conspiracy theories , fantasies of violence , apocalyptic right-wing Christian extremism and other anti-social values and beliefs among Trump 's followers and other white Americans .\nWhiteness appears to be in a state of crisis .\nTo discuss that dynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a professor of history and American studies at the University of Kansas .\nHe is the author of such notable books as `` Working Toward Whiteness , '' `` How Race Survived U.S. History '' and `` Towards the Abolition of Whiteness . ''\nHis new book is `` The Sinking Middle Class : A Political History . ''\nIn this conversation , Roediger explores the perils of increased public focus on the `` white working class '' and why that language should be used much more carefully .\nHe also addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` structural racism '' often distort and misrepresent the concept and its implications , and what many liberals and leftists misunderstand about the relationship between race and class .\nAt the end of this conversation Roediger warns that white America may be at a historical crossroads , facing a choice between embracing a more inclusive social democracy or instead becoming more reactionary and dangerous .\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity and length .\nHow are you feeling ?\nHopeful , in a way .\nThe George Floyd rebellions , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the United States , really changed things in some fundamental ways .\nOn that note , I believe that we could have thought differently about the Trump administration .\nWe could have had a strategy that envisioned bringing Trump down through popular protests .\nIn most European countries , a figure such as Donald Trump would have been protested out of office as much as he was voted out of office , and earlier probably .\nLanguage does political work .\nIt shapes reality and the limits of our collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political society and our role in it .\nFor example , in the Age of Trump , and especially in the moment of the George Floyd uprising , there were more public discussions of `` structural '' or `` institutional racism . ''\nJoe Biden is also using this language .\nI worry that most people , both in the news media and on the day-to-day , do not have a real understanding of what those words mean in practice .\nStructural racism is a very important concept , but it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is very hard to know what politicians mean when they say `` structural racism . ''\nAnd to hear police departments and law enforcement talking about structural racism particularly begs for a serious discussion of the concept as related to redress of grievances .\nThe structures in this country are such that white working people have learned that their racist claims and desires will be listened to .\nBlack people have learned that those white working people have to be placated in their racism or Democrats can not be elected .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor whites can be brought together in an alliance with antiracism , that would be an interesting moment .\n`` Working class '' is a term that has come to dominate American political discourse during the Trump regime and now beyond .\nBut it is emptied of all content and meaning .\n`` Working class '' is too often used in a superficial race- and gender-neutral way by the mainstream news media and other political elites .\nIn many ways , `` working class '' is just another way of saying `` white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep it goes unremarked upon by most .\nTo talk about the `` white working class '' is really to fight on the terrain that the likes of a Trump or a Steve Bannon or Breitbart could occupy .\nIf one goes down the road of talking about the `` white working class , '' inevitably the emphasis ends up on `` white . ''\nWith the Bannons and Trumps that `` white '' is emphasized , as in the full-blown white nationalism that they gravitate towards .\nEven with the Democrats there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' in `` white working class , '' because they do not have anything as a party to offer in terms of class or the specifics of trade policy that would actually appeal to the people in Macomb County , Michigan .\nThe Democrats are not for trade union rights in any fundamental way .\nThe Democrats are not for reorganizing the working class .\nThe Democrats are very much in favor of disastrous trade deals such as NAFTA .\nWhen political leaders and pundits say `` middle class '' they mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the middle of the class structure .\nBut for African Americans , the 50th percentile has about one-ninth of the wealth of the middle of the white class structure .\nThe term `` middle class '' obscures racial differences and related inequalities .\nI believe this has been true since at least the 1980s .\nSome of us on the left are implicated in this too , because there is a kind of left politics that argues , `` Oh , we should advance these middle-class economic demands , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about race so much .\nOur economic agenda helps everyone , so we can avoid these challenging conversations about race '' .\nThese types of approaches to class and race in America mean that there is very little space in the public discourse to seriously consider what would bring poor people together across the color line , while also being attentive to the specific grievances that African Americans and immigrants have in the United States .\nRace and class should not be discussed as being separate and apart from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally .\nWhere do you think the impulse to talk in simple terms , to decouple the two concepts , comes from ?\nFor some of us who are materialists and apply Marxist analyses , part of our worst impulses are when we argue that class concerns should submerge concerns about racial justice .\nFor all his experience with the Black Freedom Struggle , there have been too many moments when Bernie Sanders was also guilty of that type of class reductionism .\nThe fact that the Sanders 2016 campaign introduced the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a big achievement .\nGiven that , many people were willing to allow certain problems to go uncommented upon .\nIn 2020 , it seemed to me that Bernie Sanders had been given better advice about how to talk about race .\nI believe that Sanders was most comfortable in both 2016 and 2020 speaking about things that are important for Black and brown people in the United States such as Medicare for All .\nSanders was also advocating economic policies that did not have a specifically important racial dimension to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSystems of white supremacy and white racism also hurt white people .\nHow can we do a better job of explaining that to white folks ?\nThe willingness to accept dehumanization never ends at the color line .\nAs an example , America 's prison system is essentially an extension of Jim Crow that disproportionately targets young Black men .\nBut that same system , from the 1980s forward also vastly increased the number of white people who are incarcerated .\nUsing America 's Jim Crow prison system as an example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there against black men — but then , at the same time , call attention to how white people , in particular poor white people , are also being hurt by mass incarceration .\nAnother example is how the number of white women incarcerated has gone through the roof in the same period .\nHow do you think whiteness is doing at present in America ?\nA majority of whites in the United States still support Trump .\nWe often get confused by these extraordinarily close elections .\nIn fact , these elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmingly for the Democratic candidate .\nThe same is true for Latinos and Hispanics .\nThis gives the appearance that there is all this resistance against Trump and what he represents , but in reality white Americans are generally supportive of him .\nWe do not gain much in this country by denying that fact .\nThese political and cultural problems have been going on for a long time in white America .\nThose problems continued and maybe even accelerated under Donald Trump .\nMoreover , there are huge numbers of eligible voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much less likely to vote .\nThere is something wrong with America 's culture and politics that is larger than Donald Trump .\nAn example of the many problems in white America — not exclusively found among the so-called white working class — is shown through the response to COVID and refusing to wear a mask .\nThis a literal embrace of death by large numbers of white people in America .\nThe mindless embrace of death by refusing to wear a mask also represents a type of widespread malaise .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies about the opioid crisis and the so-called deaths of despair among certain segments of the white public .\nIn total , that data and other examples point to a type of psychological emergency among some whites .\nIs whiteness in some form of crisis as shown by the Age of Trump , which was at its core a white supremacist and neofascist backlash against multiracial democracy ?\nI do not subscribe to the argument that in the next few decades white people will somehow not be the largest group and that therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it in America .\nAt present there is a re-examination of the assumptions that undergird whiteness in America .\nThat could result in a type of social democracy , or whiteness could be refurbished by admitting into its ranks groups who are now considered `` people of color . ''\nThere are real possibilities of a reactionary move as well .\nWhat is a crisis ?\nSomething that we do not know where it leads .\nLots of white Americans are experiencing such a crisis ."

         "Demolition of a large cargo ship along the coast of Georgia is entering its fifth month , with work to chop the ship into eight large pieces going far slower than the salvage crew anticipated SAVANNAH , Ga. -- When salvage crews began cutting apart the capsized Golden Ray , a shipwreck the size of a 70-story office building with 4,200 cars within its cargo decks , in early November they predicted the demolition could be wrapped up by New Year 's Day .\nFour months later , the job remains far from finished .\nBoth ends of the cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by barges in a pair of giant chunks .\nBut roughly three-fourths of the vessel remains beached on its side off St. Simons Island on the Georgia coast , where the South Korean freighter overturned soon after leaving port Sept. 8 , 2019 .\n“ It ’ s been nothing but problems out here , ” said Andy Jones , a St. Simons Island resident who heads to the wreck site in his small fishing boat most days to monitor the demolition and post updates to a YouTube channel .\n“ It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvage experts decided more than a year ago that the Golden Ray , measuring 656 feet ( 199 meters ) long , was too big to remove intact .\nThey settled on a plan to carve the ship into eight massive chunks , each weighing up to 4,100 tons ( 3,720 metric tonnes ) .\nThey straddled the wreck with a towering crane with a winch and pulley system attached to 400 feet ( 122 meters ) of anchor chain that acts as a dull sawblade , tearing through the ship 's hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual cut was supposed to take a single day .\nTaking into account time needed to load each severed ship section onto a barge and prepare for the next slice , the multiagency command overseeing the effort predicted the job would take eight weeks .\nIt 's turned out to be a lot harder .\nThe first cut began Nov. 6 and took three weeks .\nLifting the ship 's bow section revealed battered cars and SUVs in neat , layered rows on the interior decks .\nThe second cut started a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished in a week .\nCrews spent the entire month of February attempting a third cut through the ship 's engine room , a section fortified with thicker steel .\nAfter strain on the cutting apparatus forced extensive maintenance , the salvage crew stopped with the cut only about half finished .\nThey spent days moving the crane to the other end of the ship , where they began cutting a new section May 7 while rethinking plans to complete the unfinished one .\nThe ship 's steel has proven tougher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews have taken pauses to perform extra inspections and maintenance , said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Himes , a spokesman for the multiagency command overseeing the demolition .\n“ If people are wondering when it is going to be done , we ’ re doing it as quickly and as safely as can be done , '' Himes said .\n`` But quick takes a back seat to safety.\n” He said it 's possible the last chunk of the ship could head to the scrapyard by June , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWorkers have taken steps to make the cutting more efficient , using torches to remove strips of the ship 's hull plating and form a guide for the cutting chain .\nThey 're also using a big mechanical claw to pluck cars from inside the ship to shed weight before sections are cut and lifted .\nConservationists worry the longer the shipwreck stays in St. Simons Sound , the greater pollution threat it poses to the area 's waterways , beaches and saltwater marshes .\nThe wreck site is surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanup once the big sections get removed .\nBoats equipped with skimmers and absorbent booms stay on standby to mop up any leaking oil or other pollutants .\nStill , bumpers , tires and other car parts falling from the ship have been found on beaches .\nBirds have been found coated in oil .\nAnd though most fuel has been drained from the ship 's tanks , there 's concern that an estimated 44,000 gallons ( 166,500 liters ) remaining could come gushing out once the cutting chain severs the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the water , the ship or these cars , it breaks down , '' said Susan Inman , coastkeeper for the Altamaha Riverkeeper conservation group .\n“ You have lead paint on your ship .\nYou have all these plastic pieces , hydraulic fluid .\nA lot of this stuff is just going to be around for years.\n” By the time demolition of the Golden Ray began in November , the project had already delayed for several months because of a busy hurricane season and handful of coronavirus infections among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site commanders insisted on removing the ship in large chunks because it was supposed to be faster .\nA year ago , the command fired its original salvage contractor for wanting to dismantle the ship in smaller pieces , saying it would take too long .\nThe jilted firm sued in federal court , but a judge refused to halt the salvage after agreeing there was no time to

         "'nothing but problems': shipwreck tear-down enters 5th month. demolition of a large cargo ship along the coast of georgia is entering its fifth month , with work to chop the ship into eight large pieces going far slower than the salvage crew anticipated savannah , ga. -- when salvage crews began cutting apart the capsized golden ray , a shipwreck the size of a 70-story office building with 4,200 cars within its cargo decks , in early november they predicted the demolition could be wrapped up by new year 's day . four months later , the job remains far from finished . both ends of the cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by barges in a pair of giant chunks . but roughly three-fourths of the vessel remains beached on its side off st. simons island on the georgia coast , where the south korean freighter overturned soon after leaving port sept. 8 , 2019 . “ it ’ s been nothing but problems out here , ” said andy jones , a st. simons island resident who heads to the wreck site in his small fishing boat most days to monitor the demolition and post updates to a youtube channel . “ it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvage experts decided more than a year ago that the golden ray , measuring 656 feet ( 199 meters ) long , was too big to remove intact . they settled on a plan to carve the ship into eight massive chunks , each weighing up to 4,100 tons ( 3,720 metric tonnes ) . they straddled the wreck with a towering crane with a winch and pulley system attached to 400 feet ( 122 meters ) of anchor chain that acts as a dull sawblade , tearing through the ship 's hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual cut was supposed to take a single day . taking into account time needed to load each severed ship section onto a barge and prepare for the next slice , the multiagency command overseeing the effort predicted the job would take eight weeks . it 's turned out to be a lot harder . the first cut began nov. 6 and took three weeks . lifting the ship 's bow section revealed battered cars and suvs in neat , layered rows on the interior decks . the second cut started a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished in a week . crews spent the entire month of february attempting a third cut through the ship 's engine room , a section fortified with thicker steel . after strain on the cutting apparatus forced extensive maintenance , the salvage crew stopped with the cut only about half finished . they spent days moving the crane to the other end of the ship , where they began cutting a new section may 7 while rethinking plans to complete the unfinished one . the ship 's steel has proven tougher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews have taken pauses to perform extra inspections and maintenance , said coast guard petty officer 2nd class michael himes , a spokesman for the multiagency command overseeing the demolition . “ if people are wondering when it is going to be done , we ’ re doing it as quickly and as safely as can be done , '' himes said . `` but quick takes a back seat to safety. ” he said it 's possible the last chunk of the ship could head to the scrapyard by june , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . workers have taken steps to make the cutting more efficient , using torches to remove strips of the ship 's hull plating and form a guide for the cutting chain . they 're also using a big mechanical claw to pluck cars from inside the ship to shed weight before sections are cut and lifted . conservationists worry the longer the shipwreck stays in st. simons sound , the greater pollution threat it poses to the area 's waterways , beaches and saltwater marshes . the wreck site is surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanup once the big sections get removed . boats equipped with skimmers and absorbent booms stay on standby to mop up any leaking oil or other pollutants . still , bumpers , tires and other car parts falling from the ship have been found on beaches . birds have been found coated in oil . and though most fuel has been drained from the ship 's tanks , there 's concern that an estimated 44,000 gallons ( 166,500 liters ) remaining could come gushing out once the cutting chain severs the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the water , the ship or these cars , it breaks down , '' said susan inman , coastkeeper for the altamaha riverkeeper conservation group . “ you have lead paint on your ship . you have all these plastic pieces , hydraulic fluid . a lot of this stuff is just going to be around for years. ” by the time demolition of the golden ray began in november , the project had already delayed for several months because of a busy hurricane season and handful of coronavirus infections among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site commanders insisted on removing the ship in large chunks because it was supposed to be faster . a year ago , the command fired its original salvage contractor for wanting to dismantle the ship in smaller pieces , saying it would take too long . the jilted firm sued in federal court , but a judge refused to halt the salvage after agreeing there was no time to waste . paul hankins oversaw planning for a smaller-scale demolition of the golden ray until his employer , donjon-smit , lost the job to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company . had his team not been fired , hankins said , the overturned ship would now be a memory in coastal georgia . “ we would have been done , ” hankins said . “ here we are a year later , and they ’ re nowhere close . ”"

Well , you know , how did I wind up with the agency is pretty easy .\nI was born into it .\nMy dad was not in O.S.S .\nbut was a charter member of CIA when it was formed in '47 .\nAnd the time I was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , I went to American University and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family .\nI then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that I 'd have a career in operations .\nBut I found my interim assignments and the Directorate of Intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old Office of Current Intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Near East and South Asian Analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late Bob Ames and Helene Boatner .\nWorked for them until 1985 or so .\nThen I went to the Office of Global Issues as a deputy to David Carey , who later became executive director of the agency .\nI worked for Dave four or five times .\nAnd got my first division assignment running the International Issues Division in OGI .\nAnd I did that for five years .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IG staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for Bob Layton and the Office of Near East South Asian Analysis , as head of the Persian Gulf Division .\nAnd that 's where I was when on the day Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1991 .\nWorked through 1992 on running Persian Gulf Division and found time to look for another job after five years at NESA and was asked to become the deputy in the in the Counterterrorism Center .\nThe center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst .\nAnd I got to work with Steve Ahr as his deputy for two years .\nSteve moved up to be the chief of the NE Division and I took over as chief of CTC .\nAnd brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order .\nAnd I spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where I found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence .\nYou were in charge of all the analysts .\nYou were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 .\nCan you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out .\nWe write the first draft and put to bed the President 's Daily Brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those .\nIn the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the DI .\nAnd my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible .\nMICHAEL MORELL ?\nWinston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in CTC and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-Qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ?\nHow were you thinking about that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , we 'd been worried about al-Qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew .\nWhile I was still in CTC , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort .\nReally with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al Qaeda as a group .\nWe tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues .\nThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one .\nAfter 9/11 , that changed .\nMICHAEL MORELL : OK , Winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ?\nI know you did not plan to come to work that day .\nCan you walk us through it for us ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well .\nIndeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at BWI Airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the United States as the attacks were going on .\nI 'll never forget the phone call I got as I was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the World Trade Center .\nI sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORELL : So I suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yes .\nI knew it in my bones .\nIt did n't require me to sit down and ponder .\nA single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident .\nA second , no sir .\nYou know , I ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise .\nWINSTON WILEY : It would have to have been at the top of the list .\nA coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the Pentagon and later understanding what happened in Shanksville .\nThere just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Surprisingly , very , very little .\nWhen I went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate .\nAt that point .\nI was directed towards the security guy who told me I needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - I went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand .\nAn unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to BWI MICHAEL MORELL : And did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ?\nWINSTON WILEY : I got to the gate .\nAnd I had told them , you know , 'You guys are n't flying today . '\nThe word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled .\nI was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you took them home .\nAnd did you come to work then ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I took them home .\nBut you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home .\nAnd that was just a solid jam .\nI turned around and went to the Baltimore Washington Parkway and took that down .\nIt took a lifetime of living in the Washington area , knowing back roads to get to places .\nAll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower Pennsylvania , Delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the Pentagon fire .\nAnd I guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where I rejoined my deputies and George and others .\nI was in touch by phone .\nThe team knew very well what to do , if nothing else .\nI mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus .\nAnd the team fell back on that .\nAnd , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support .\nI think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period .\nLeave it to him to decide .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ?\nWell , I 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could .\nWhat that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-Qaida and its supporters ?\nWe had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by Marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate .\nMy immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing CTC analytic firepower .\nAnd I remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , I think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to CTC and created an Office of Terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , in fact , you moved , I think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Yeah .\nAnd I remember entire teams .\nRight .\nTeams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one .\nThey would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated .\nWe asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be .\nAnd I gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that .\nBut the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases I think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible .\nThere were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the FBI stand up its new analytic capability .\nThe president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to CIA for help in .\nAnd you provided it .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , I 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the FBI counterterrorism folks during my time in CTC , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while .\nAnd , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help .\nIt was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts .\nThat was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the CTC .\nBut we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities .\nIt 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing .\nThe analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was .\nSo it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , yeah , and then I think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which I think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Yeah .\nWhen you asked earlier what we were doing in our day to day , we had always tried to be focused on the latest threats and conscious of the fact that , you know , we would need to go deeper , we built analytic structures , a threat matrix and teams of of analysts so that every single threat report that we got , no matter how apparently far fetched , would be chased to ground..\nMany , many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably without basis , but we had no ability to be confident of that short of doing the work .\nAnd I think that one of the big changes after 9/11 is that nothing was dismissed as being too small .\nBut that is a labor intensive task .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So sometime after 9/11 , George Tenet , the Director of Central Intelligence at the time , asked you to take on a new senior assignment , to create a new position .\nCan you talk about that a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June of the following year , the director asked if I would stand up a position , called the Associate Director for Homeland Security .\nBy then the White House had decided that there would be a full-time department , a cabinet level Department of Homeland Security and wanted to make sure that there was the same kind of focus on supporting the creation of that department as there would be on any other major intelligence issue .\nAs ADCI , he asked not that I assume line responsibility for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Homeland Security , but that I use the background and knowledge that I had in the intelligence community and my relationships across the community to bring what we could to that effort .\nI added one deputy from the ops directorate at CIA , another deputy from NSA , one from DIA and one from NSA , and we could and did react by being able to reach straight to leadership in those departments to make sure that new intelligence , new threat warnings , the decision to reallocate resources in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done seamlessly and help the director manage his community responsibilities .\nAt the time , the DCI had both CIA and community responsibilities , which is not the organization that exists at this point .\nAnd so with the creation of CTC those responsibilities more naturally fell on the community side .\nAnd , you know , I think even if you worked in that environment for a while .\nMICHAEL MORELL : So , Winston , maybe kind of jump jump around here , kind of big picture a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government brought Osama bin Laden to justice on May 1st , 2011 .\nWhat was your reaction ?\nWhat was your reaction when you heard that ?\nWINSTON WILEY : Elation .\nJust , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever I was watching , there was really only one thing I could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , I watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated .\nMICHAEL MORELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , I want you to compare it to the bringing of Mir Aimal Kanzi to justice .\nI think you were at Dulles Airport , along with Director Tenet when the FBI returned him to the United States from Pakistan .\nAnd maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there .\nWINSTON WILEY : Well , Mir Aimal Kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the Clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three .\nThat began - at the time I was the relatively new deputy director in CTC and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work .\nAnd I was in CTC for five years after that .\nAnd every night before I left , I got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for Mir Aimal Kanzi .\nWithout going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the FBI was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the United States to be turned over to Virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here .\nI was asked along with many others , if I wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , I would not have missed it .\nI wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers .\nI saw him march by on the arms of Brad Garrett , the lead FBI officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers .\nBut Brad marched them from the Air Force plane that brought him into Dulles Airport , because it was in Virginia and in the same Fairfax County district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial .\nYou know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ?\nIt was n't elation at all .\nIt was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when I saw , 'Wow , what a weaselly little character he was . '\nMICAHEL MORELL : Winston , I would n't be doing my job if I did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course .\nWe 're taping this the day after Kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the Taliban won .\nAnd I 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday .\nWINSTON WILEY : Michael , it 's too soon .\nI 've been you know , I 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment .\nIt will change us .\nI hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm Winston , maybe just one more question , and I was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about Bob Ames .\nYes .\nAnd you talked about working for him when he was running the Near East South Asia office .\nAnd I would bet most of my listeners do n't know about Bob .\nAnd I was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened .\nSince we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the Middle East , there is a book that was written by Kai Bird about him , 'The Perfect Spy ' by Kai Bird .\nTo all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read .\nBob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people I 've met .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Middle East .\nAnd Director Casey asked him to take over NESA and one of the very few people that I recall , having served as both the director of a DI office and in a senior position .\nAnd as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to Lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed Bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building .\nHis loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man .\nI think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency .\nAnd we lost him far too young an age .\nMICHAEL MORELL : Winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today .",

'' download , rate and subscribe here : itunes , spotify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcome to intelligence matters . it is very good to have you on the show . and much more important than that , it is very good to talk with you again . winston wiley : good to talk to you . michael morell : so , winston , given that we have so many currently serving intelligence officers who are listeners of the podcast , i wanted to mention before we talk about 9/11 , one thing that perhaps you do n't know or perhaps you do know , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my career . and one thing in particular comes to mind to me , which is you gave me a piece of advice once about career management that not only turned out to be true for me , but turned out to be something that i would repeat over and over again to officers who worked for me . and i do n't know if you remember that or not , but we were on a trip together to hawaii . and i had just given some horrible career advice to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mentoring me , you told me that assignments , job assignments outside the chain of command , the ones that take you away from just being focused on the next step in the management ladder are the ones that really matter in a career and are the ones that actually build the breadth that one needs to be a senior officer and that are the jobs you 'll actually remember , you know , in retirement someday . i really took that to heart . and for me , that became being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pdb staff , briefing the president , serving overseas . and i just wanted to let you know and to let all my listeners know who are thinking about how to manage your career , that that advice was was incredibly important to me and i think should be important to them . winston wiley : oh , well , thank you for remembering that . i do n't remember in as much details as you just made . it 's consistent with what i believe and what i tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jumping from place to place . i saw it as an opportunity to get spread across the range of activities that our agency afforded us and a job the chance to do that better . so my time in ctc and then coming back to be addi and adci for homeland security was kind of true to that . and i and i tried to share that with as many people as possible . and i 'm glad you found it useful . michael morell : i listened . i actually listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great transition , winston , you know , because there 's so many young officers who listen to the podcast and because there 's so many students who listen to the podcast and who are thinking about their future career trajectory . before we talk about 9/11 , i 'd love if you could give us a kind of a synopsis of your career up to 9/11 . we 'll talk about your career after 9/11 later . but but if you could share , how did you end up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have there leading up to 9/11 ? winston wiley : ok. well , you know , how did i wind up with the agency is pretty easy . i was born into it . my dad was not in o.s.s . but was a charter member of cia when it was formed in '47 . and the time i was born to , you know , rush forward , you know , up into college years , i went to american university and took a part time job that exposed me to clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of made me part of the family . i then went into the service and came back in 1972 and went into the career training program , frankly , anticipating that i 'd have a career in operations . but i found my interim assignments and the directorate of intelligence immediately fascinating and impactful and signed on to be an analyst in the old office of current intelligence that morphed into the new structure that the agency took on , the directorate of intelligence took on in the late 70s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the near east and south asian analysis as research director and executive officer , among others for the great late bob ames and helene boatner . worked for them until 1985 or so . then i went to the office of global issues as a deputy to david carey , who later became executive director of the agency . i worked for dave four or five times . and got my first division assignment running the international issues division in ogi . and i did that for five years . i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ig staff for a year , came back to that in 1990 to work for bob layton and the office of near east south asian analysis , as head of the persian gulf division . and that 's where i was when on the day saddam invaded kuwait in 1991 . worked through 1992 on running persian gulf division and found time to look for another job after five years at nesa and was asked to become the deputy in the in the counterterrorism center . the center was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior ops officer and a senior analyst . and i got to work with steve ahr as his deputy for two years . steve moved up to be the chief of the ne division and i took over as chief of ctc . and brought on a very capable deputy from the ops side , so we continued the tradition of having one ops one intel , just in this case , we reversed the order . and i spent five years building a program , it 's hard to imagine how small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s and how it grew through the 90s , but only exploded after 9/11 , and which is where i found myself then as associate deputy director for intelligence . michael morell : so , winston , you were the deputy director for intelligence . you were in charge of all the analysts . you were the agency 's senior analyst on 9/11 . can you just very briefly explain to people what is that job and what was a typical day like for you ? winston wiley : well , the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called at that time , is responsible for organizing and producing the intelligence product that the agency puts out . we write the first draft and put to bed the president 's daily brief , for most of the drafting for long term analysis and heavy part of the load in doing national estimates and both drafting and coordinating those . in the counterterrorism arena , we had a substantial but not huge analytic presence embedded in the counterterrorism center to do traditional analytic work , as well as a cadre of analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the tradecraft that they develop in the di . and my job , along with my two two immediate deputies , was to make sure that we got the right resources to the right people and valued the product and maintained its quality and tried to grow as much as possible . michael morell ? winston , given that the jobs you had , particularly to your time in ctc and then of course , you could n't ignore it as as deputy director for intelligence , al-qaida was was a focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm just wondering sort of how worried were you about the group in general prior to 9/11 and how worried were you in particular that summer , given all the warnings that we had in the spring and early summer ? how were you thinking about that ? winston wiley : well , we 'd been worried about al-qaida as a group from back to the middle of the previous decade as they grew . while i was still in ctc , the creation of virtual stations to manage the effort against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and growing effort . really with almost every passing season , we used the analytic presentations of the director to push on the leadership , both the size , the scope and the potential significance of al qaeda as a group . we tried to do everything we could to add resources , both analytical and operational to that effort , it was by far the largest effort for the center and yet not as large as the effort that we devoted to to some nation state issues . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big effort , but not the most substantial one . after 9/11 , that changed . michael morell : ok , winston , can you walk us through the day of 9/11 for you ? i know you did not plan to come to work that day . can you walk us through it for us ? winston wiley : well . indeed , the the morning of 9/11 found me at bwi airport , putting my youngest daughter on an airplane at nine o'clock in the morning on her way to california @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her did she not take an earlier flight that would have had her in the air over the united states as the attacks were going on . i 'll never forget the phone call i got as i was parking the car from my secretary and letting me know that there had been , first one , and as we spoke , a second crash into the world trade center . i sensed immediately the dramatic changes that that would put on us as a nation , let alone an agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morell : so i suppose you knew immediately that this was terrorism ? winston wiley : yes . i knew it in my bones . it did n't require me to sit down and ponder . a single incident into the tower , perhaps an accident . a second , no sir . you know , i ca n't imagine that anyone thought otherwise . winston wiley : it would have to have been at the top of the list . a coordinated attack with at the first two , and then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were more planes aloft the world that represented a threat with the attack on the pentagon and later understanding what happened in shanksville . there just were n't very many groups that could muster the the resources , the training , the tradecraft to be able to do that . michael morell : so what happened at the airport as the word started to spread ? winston wiley : surprisingly , very , very little . when i went from the parking lot into the building , the local television sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and but they were continuing to process tickets for people to go into the waiting areas and in fact , trying to go find my my wife and daughter who were at the gate . at that point . i was directed towards the security guy who told me i needed a gate ticket , which turned out to be - i went back to the desk and turned out to be a simple ticket stub with the words 'gate ticket ' written on them by hand . an unimaginable difference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to what happened in the immediate aftermath or even this afternoon , if you were to go back out to bwi michael morell : and did you you got to the gate and did you put your daughter on that flight or - ? winston wiley : i got to the gate . and i had told them , you know , 'you guys are n't flying today . ' the word had come out , the airport was being shut down and all flights were canceled . i was pushing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you took them home . and did you come to work then ? winston wiley : well , i took them home . but you can imagine what the traffic was like on - we went over to back over to 95 to try to take them home . and that was just a solid jam . i turned around and went to the baltimore washington parkway and took that down . it took a lifetime of living in the washington area , knowing back roads to get to places . all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , you know , overtaking me , coming from lower pennsylvania , delaware , other places like that heading towards towards the pentagon fire . and i guess to be on site took me probably three hours , four hours to get back home and then back over to the agency where i rejoined my deputies and george and others . i was in touch by phone . the team knew very well what to do , if nothing else . i mean , you probably remember that we there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced us to look at how we dealt with emergencies and we 'd actually set up an alternate site to work on them on campus . and the team fell back on that . and , you know , we were able to both produce intelligence and provide support . i think we took pretty good care of supporting the director during that period . leave it to him to decide . michael morell : so , winston , in the days immediately after 9/11 , what were you focused on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? well , i 'd say it was part of the overall effort that was led by by the director to make sure that we responded in as thorough and aggressive way as we could . what that meant principally and , you know , from my point of view was what could we do to more quickly create more analytic capability focused exclusively on al-qaida and its supporters ? we had been undertaking a review of what our structure and resources were , led by marty and that provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty granular fashion of what we were doing and how much and how many of us were doing that for each account in the directorate . my immediate , almost immediate conclusion was that we needed to double and redouble what we were doing and providing ctc analytic firepower . and i remember thinking , 'better to overshoot than to undershoot in responding to that , ' and we put together a plan , i think within a week , to make the largest reallocation of resources in the directorate 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every office and subordinated them to ctc and created an office of terrorism analysis and a fully capable standalone office , you know , embedded in the counterterrorism center . michael morell : so , in fact , you moved , i think , a couple of hundred , if not 300 analysts . michael morell : yeah . and i remember entire teams . right . teams working on one issue or another were grabbed in whole and taken . winston wiley : well that was my strategy there was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and move them , that we move branch units with their leadership as one . they would n't physically move , they would just be resubordinated . we asked the office directors to figure out which branches that ought to be . and i gave them target numbers and said , pull one or two people back , hold one or two people back to continue to do the work on the original target countries and then directed a move to very senior and experienced officer to take over the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure out of that . but the idea was essentially , we moved units as a whole with their branch chiefs and in some cases i think more senior officers so that , you know , they were used to working with each other , they were used to the leadership and try to make that transition as smooth as possible . there were a few people startled by this , but there was more even excitement at the possibility of weighing in in the immediate aftermath of this crisis than there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other things that you had to do was to help the fbi stand up its new analytic capability . the president was asking much more of the bureau than had been asked previously , and they turned to cia for help in . and you provided it . winston wiley : well , i 'd been able to develop a pretty good relationship with the fbi counterterrorism folks during my time in ctc , we 'd even gone as far as swapping deputies for a while . and , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for help . it was , frankly , a heavier lift to get people to go down to the bureau to to work as analysts . that was not seen as being directly helpful as moving to the ctc . but we did in the end find a dozen or so folks that went down and helped them set up their first analytic capabilities . it 's hard to build a structure from next to nothing . the analytic culture and the analytic focus that our friends in the bureau had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience was . so it was with they needed manpower , they needed some advice , and we had to try to make it not appear as if we were the pros coming in telling them how to do their business . michael morell : so , yeah , and then i think one of the probably , you know , biggest issues we had post-9/11 , as you well know , was a deep concern about follow-on attacks , which i think a lot of people really do n't understand the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about that a little bit ?

what was your reaction when you heard that ? winston wiley : elation . just , you know , when they broke into the broadcast , whatever i was watching , there was really only one thing i could imagine would bring the president to the news and , you know , i watched the words form on his lips and could not have been could not have been more elated . michael morell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare it to something else , i want you to compare it to the bringing of mir aimal kanzi to justice . i think you were at dulles airport , along with director tenet when the fbi returned him to the united states from pakistan . and maybe before you tell us how you reacted to that moment , maybe you could just tell our listeners a word about who he was and why why you were there . winston wiley : well , mir aimal kanzi was the shooter in an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1993 , right in the beginning of the clinton administration where he shot and killed two of our fellow officers and wounded another three . that began - at the time i was the relatively new deputy director in ctc and that , needless to say , became a leading target for our work . and i was in ctc for five years after that . and every night before i left , i got an update on where we were in a worldwide hunt for mir aimal kanzi . without going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found and brought back , the day did come in 1997 when the fbi was able to seize control and we were able to have him not extradited , but rendered back to the united states to be turned over to virginia law enforcement and presented in courts here . i was asked along with many others , if i wanted to go out to the airport to see him come in , i would not have missed it . i wanted the chance to see face to face somebody that had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed our fellow officers . i saw him march by on the arms of brad garrett , the lead fbi officer for the entire five years , great officer who remains active in and pursuing criminals and other murderers . but brad marched them from the air force plane that brought him into dulles airport , because it was in virginia and in the same fairfax county district that the crime was committed and over to the helicopter that took him to the prison and pursued the trial . you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was my reaction ? it was n't elation at all . it was , you know , just , you know , disgust more than anything else , when i saw , 'wow , what a weaselly little character he was . ' micahel morell : winston , i would n't be doing my job if i did n't ask the following question here and you can choose to answer it to how you want , of course . we 're taping this the day after kabul has fallen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and the taliban won . and i 'd just love your reaction to what happened yesterday . winston wiley : michael , it 's too soon . i 've been you know , i 've been gnashing my teeth and listening to my stomach juices growl all morning long , it 's , you know , it 's a historical moment . it will change us . i hope not in a completely risk-averse way , but we 've got to get smarter in what we do in events like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : i 'm winston , maybe just one more question , and i was n't even planning on asking it , but earlier you talked about bob ames . yes . and you talked about working for him when he was running the near east south asia office . and i would bet most of my listeners do n't know about bob . and i was hoping you make it take a couple of minutes and talk about him and what happened . since we 're talking about cheery things here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , one of the leading ops officers in the middle east , there is a book that was written by kai bird about him , 'the perfect spy ' by kai bird . to all of your listeners who are at all interested in understanding an important part of agency history , that book is absolutely to be read . bob was , in addition to his skills and contacts as an operations officer , he was one of the most carefully read and analytical people i 've met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the middle east . and director casey asked him to take over nesa and one of the very few people that i recall , having served as both the director of a di office and in a senior position . and as the cowbirds book lays out , he was on a trip to to lebanon and was in the embassy when it was destroyed in a bombing that killed bob and more than a half dozen other agency officers , as well as other people in the building . his loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a young man . i think he had the potential and vision and leadership to have risen to the top of the agency . and we lost him far too young an age . michael morell : winston , thank you so much for spending time with us today ."

         "The Delta variant of the virus causing Covid-19 has caused infections to spike in the UK once more , preventing the planned relaxation of lockdown in England .\nBut is it really faring worse than other countries ?\nWhere is the Delta variant ?\nLabs around the world that analyse the virus 's genetic material have been sharing their findings to a global database .\nWhen you look at this , the UK looks like it has more cases of the Delta variant than most of the rest of the world .\nBy the week beginning 14 June , 2,853 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , 747 in Germany , 277 in Spain and 97 in Denmark , according to a global monitoring website .\nBut this is not a definitive record of how many cases there are - it 's a record of how many are spotted , and the UK has a very good system for spotting variants .\nSo it 's likely these figures disguise a much greater incidence of the variant in some countries that carry out less sequencing - genetic analysis - of the virus .\nFor example , there were 875 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week beginning 3 May , when the virus was raging , and just 142 in the past four weeks .\nThat 's despite the country recording between half a million and two million new cases a week since the start of May , with Delta believed to be the dominant variant .\nThis does n't mean there is n't a problem in the UK though - cases have generally been falling across mainland Europe .\nAnd some countries that do a lot of sequencing , such as Denmark , have not seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's government has warned that it 's likely to become the dominant strain and the Welsh government says the Delta variant is driving a rise in infection , with the country at the start of a third wave of coronavirus .\nWhy is it so bad in the UK compared with other countries ?\nExperts believe a major factor is the number of cases that were introduced into the UK in a short space of time , because of the volume of travel .\nDr Jeffrey Barrett , from the Sanger Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swabs to work out which mutations they contain , said he believed the true number was likely to be more than 1,000 .\nThis is important because of the irregular way the virus spreads .\nWe talk about the R number meaning that , with no distancing or infection control measures in place , one person might infect three others on average .\nBut in reality , it 's not the case that every single person infects three others .\nInstead , one person might infect 30 others while another person infects no-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their biology , behaviour or living conditions .\nThere 's an element of chance - if five people arrive in the UK carrying the variant , you could get lucky and none of them would pass it on .\nIf 500 come in , it 's just more likely at least one will pass on their infection , or even be a super-spreader .\nSo the difference between five and 500 travellers entering with the Delta variant wo n't be exactly 100 times the infections - it could be the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking off .\nOn top of this , the Delta variant entered the UK at a time when restrictions were being relaxed and in cold weather .\nThe cold snap would have seen more people indoors and thus spreading infection , but also the virus surviving longer outdoors .\nExperts believe some countries may already be heading the same way as the UK - but that they have genetic sequencing programmes which analyse fewer swabs , more slowly , meaning we ca n't see it in the data yet .\nAnd in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been introduced slightly later -

official 9/11 conspiracy theorists , would do such a thing ?\nAnd for what purpose ?\nWatch on Archive / BitChute / Odysee or Download the mp4 video For those with limited bandwidth , CLICK HERE to

Day in Egypt and the streets of Alexandria are teeming with revelers .\nTwo men—Victor Levy and Philip Natanson—pick their way through the crowd on their way to the cinema quarter , each nervously clutching a device in their pocket .\nEyeing the fire trucks parked at the intersections , Philip leans over to Victor and whispers : “ They ’ re expecting us.\n” They reach the steps of the Rio Cinema just as the audience from the afternoon showing begin pouring out of the entrance .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people and into the foyer and immediately see a man in the usual garb of an Egyptian plainclothes detective waiting for them .\nPhilip turns to run away but instantly a wave of heat begins to sear his thigh .\nHe tries to tell Victor to run , but no words come out .\nInstead , a white hot flame leaps from his trousers .\nHe squeezes his thigh with all his strength in a vain attempt to stop the flame before the bomb can ignite—but it ’ s too late .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs burnt black from the bomb .\nVictor is nowhere to be seen .\nSoon , a police sergeant arrives , along with the plainclothes detective .\nSomeone in the crowd shouts , “ Take care !\nHe may have another bomb !\n” But the sergeant moves in all the same .\n“ Don ’ t worry .\nWe were waiting for them.\n” The police had been expecting them .\nVictor and Philip were Egyptian Jews , members of a sleeper cell established by Israeli military intelligence in 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the military coup in Egypt in 1952 led to the rise of Gamel Abdel Nasser , who was not only hostile to Israel , but who , as a perceived anti-communist , was securing military and financial aid from the Americans and even the British .\nWith Britain already staging talks to withdraw from their Suez military base , Israel decided to act .\nIn 1954 , they activated their military intelligence sleeper cell in the country for an audacious mission .\nCodenamed Operation Susannah , their plan was to stage an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexandria .\nThe first bombing—an explosion at the Alexandria central post office on July 2nd—had gone off without a hitch .\nThe second , a simultaneous attack on the American Libraries in Cairo and Alexandria , was similarly successful .\nIt was their third attack—an ambitious attempt to bomb two cinemas in Cairo , two in Alexandria and the Cairo railway station—that failed , derailing the operation .\nTen members of the cell were rounded up .\nOf the ten , two committed suicide in the course of their interrogations by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and six were sentenced to prison , eventually making their way to Israel after their release .\nAfter decades of internal Israeli investigations , finger pointing , political scandal and high-profile resignations , the full truth of Operation Susannah remains shrouded in official secrecy .\nThe Israeli government did not even formally acknowledge the incident until 2005 , a full half century after the affair , when nine of the agents were officially commended for their service .\nBut the reasoning behind the operation was revealed during one of the commissions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair .\nAccording to one officer who was given oral instructions directly from Israel ’ s Military Intelligence chief , Binyamin Gibli : In short , the Israelis had attempted a false flag operation , hoping to blame their own spectacular acts of violence on the Muslim Brotherhood or the communists in order to destabilize Nasser ’ s government , undermine Western confidence in its Egyptian ally , and persuade the British military to remain at their Suez base .\nThe operation was a failure in every sense .\nThe cell was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not destabilize the Nasser government , nor did they influence the relationship between Egypt and the West .\nAnd the British did leave their base in 1956 , after an abortive Israeli/British/French invasion of the region was brought to an end by the US and the Soviets .\nBut it did implant an idea in the minds of the Western military planners : that acts of terrorism could be staged and blamed on Muslim scapegoats to further their own political goals .\nAs we shall see , it was not long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own operational plans making use of this tactic .\n.\n.\nplans that would culminate in the most spectacular terrorist attack the world had yet seen .\nTuesday , September 11 , 2001 , dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States .\nIn a matter of moments , however , the quiet of that Tuesday morning transformed into the turbulence of 9/11 and the world seemed to turn upside-down .\nAs the events of that day played out like a Hollywood movie on tv screens around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from clear .\nWho was behind this attack ?\nWhy were they attacking ?\nWhat did the perpetrators hope to gain from it ?\nAnd yet it was there , in the initial hours of those chaotic events—years before the congressional inquiries and presidential commissions presumed to answer those questions—that all of the essential pieces of the official story of 9/11 were laid out on the tv screens of the American public .\nRemarkably , these initial , off-the-cuff speculations turned out to be—according to the various inquiries and investigations that followed—accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden , the mastermind of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization , had planned and directed this attack .\nThe Twin Towers had collapsed due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense .\nThese assertions , drilled into the minds of a susceptible audience still reeling in shock from the horror of the events they had just witnessed , became the core tenets of what would become enshrined in the final report of the 9/11 Commission as the “ official story ” of 9/11 .\nIn this official story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Soviet warrior on the road to peace , ” was now an international terror kingpin .\nRadicalized by the arrival of US military forces in the Arabian peninsula in the Gulf war , he issued a fatwa against the United States and began a series of strikes on US targets ; first bombing the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998 , and then bombing the USS Cole while it was harbored in Aden in October of 2000 .\nAccording to this version of events , the 9/11 plot was hatched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated ” Pakistani militant who presented the “ planes operation “ —as the 9/11 Commission asserts it was originally known—to Osama bin Laden and his chief of operations , Mohammed Atef , in 1996 .\nIt was bin Laden , we are told , who greenlighted the operation “ sometime in late 1998 or early 1999.\n” The three of them developed a list of buildings to be targeted—the White House , the U.S. Capitol , the Pentagon , and the World Trade Center—and bin Laden himself hand-picked the men he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operatives into place over the course of the next two years , this crack terror squad—devoted Muslim radicals willing to die for their beliefs—succeeded through a combination of skill and the colossal failure of the American intelligence complex , hindered by bureaucracy and hampered by a lack of political will to recognize the growing threat of Islamic terror .\nNo individual was to blame for this “ failure , ” the official story of 9/11 concludes , but the remedy to the problems presented by the 9/11 attack was obvious : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear down the walls between foreign intelligence and domestic policing , implement warrantless surveillance and other legally dubious means of disrupting potential terror threats on the home front , and launch a war on terror abroad to bring the battle to the terrorists .\nBut this narrative , now enshrined as the official history of 9/11—that the 9/11 plot was hatched by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 1996 , that it was directed by terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden and that it was executed by Al Qaeda so flawlessly that the intelligence agencies could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone prevented it— —is now contested in every respect , even by defenders of that official history .\nAs even mainstream authors like Jason Burke were forced to admit , the popular conception of Al Qaeda—that of a top-down organization with a single leader overseeing its operations—was a convenient fiction , created by the FBI so they could prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa .\nIn order to prosecute bin Laden , they had to show that Al Qaeda “ coordinates the activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden , as the leader of the group , bears the responsibility for any actions attributed to the organization .\nEven the 9/11 Commission ’ s final report had to admit that Al Qaeda was less of a mafia-like organization with a capo served by his faithful lieutenants and more of a funding organization for “ terrorist entrepreneurs.\n” “ Al Qaeda ’ s worldwide terrorist operations , ” the report conceded , “ relied heavily on the ideas and work of enterprising and strong-willed field commanders who enjoyed considerable autonomy.\n” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exploration , Origin Story , these “ terrorist entrepreneurs ” included among their ranks renowned international Islamic radicals—like “ The Blind Sheikh , ” Omar Abdel-Rahman—and lesser-known but incredibly prolific terror cell leaders—like Ali Mohamed—whose remarkable abilities to evade State Department watch lists and foment and direct spectacular terror attacks directly under the nose of the intelligence agencies defies explanation .\n.\n.\nunless one assumes , as their closest associates did , that they were working under the purview of those intelligence agencies .\nIn order to better understand this aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to 1990 , the year that the specter of Islamic terror appeared on the shores of the United States .\nAbdullah Azzam—Osama bin Laden ’ s mentor and co-founder with bin Laden of the Maktab al-Khidamat ( MAK ) , or the “ Office of Services , ” which provided funding , training and an international support network to the “ Afghan Arabs ” during the Soviet-Afghan war—is dead , killed in a car bombing in Peshawar , Pakistan .\nIt is never determined who committed the assassination , but Azzam ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of the jihad movement .\nAzzam had favoured continuing the fight in Afghanistan , pressing for the formation of an Islamic regime in Kabul .\nBin Laden had other ideas ; and now , as the undisputed leader of the old MAK network , he is free to pursue those ideas under the “ Al Qaeda ” banner .\nBut “ Al Qaeda , ” at this point , barely even exists as a propaganda construct .\nDespite grandiose visions of creating “ a unified global jihad movement , ” the withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the war leaves the group ’ s future in doubt .\nBin Laden returns to Saudi Arabia , looking for ways to leverage his family ’ s wealth and power to make a name for himself in the Muslim world .\nMeanwhile , in New York , the era of “ Islamic terror ” in the United States is about to begin .\nMeir Kahane—an Orthodox Jewish rabbi and a convicted terrorist whose anti-Arab views were considered so extreme he was banned from the Israeli Knesset—has just finished delivering a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Marriott East Side Hotel .\nLeaving the podium , Kahane has begun mingling with the crowd .\nSuddenly one man , Sayyid Nosair , draws a .357 Magnum and fires , hitting Kahane twice , once in the neck .\nNosair flees , shooting one of Kahane ’ s supporters in the leg in his rush out the door .\nHis accomplice , Mahmud Abouhalima , is supposed to be waiting at the front door in a taxi to drive him away , but the doorman had waved Abouhalima away moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong cab by mistake .\nWhen he realizes his error , he brandishes the .357 , ordering the cabbie to start driving .\nInstead , the driver scrambles out of the taxi and runs away .\nNosair is forced to flee on foot , racing down Lexington Avenue with his gun still in hand .\nCarlos Acosta , a US postal inspector , tries to stop him , drawing his weapon , but it ’ s too late ; Nosair fires first , hitting Acosta in the shoulder .\nUndeterred , Acosta drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots back , hitting Nosair in the neck .\nBoth Nosair and Kahane are rushed to Bellevue Hospital ’ s trauma unit .\nNosair survives his emergency operation .\nKahane does not .\nThe dramatic events of that November night would culminate in an even more surprising verdict 13 months later .\nNot only was Nosair treated as a “ lone gunman ” acting of his own accord , but he was not even convicted of Kahane ’ s murder .\nDespite such a brazen assassination—perpetrated in a crowded room and followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , convicted instead on four lesser counts , including gun possession , assault and coercion .\nHe was sentenced to just 22 years .\nSo , what went wrong ?\nThe jurors contend that they had “ reasonable doubt ” of Nosair ’ s guilt because “ the prosecution did not offer a witness during the five-week trial who saw the defendant fire the fatal shots ” and—since Kahane ’ s family had opposed an autopsy—the fatal bullet could not be matched to Nosair ’ s weapon .\nBut , in reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs even the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks conceded in a staff statement a decade after the trial : The typically bureaucratic wording of the statement obscures the reality : the NYPD and the District Attorney ’ s office didn ’ t just passively resist the attempts to “ label ” the assassination a “ conspiracy ” ; they deliberately covered up vitally important information that would have unwound that conspiracy and undermined the next decade of spectacular Al Qaeda terrorism .\nImmediately after his arrest , forty-seven boxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in New Jersey .\nAmong those materials were Top Secret training manuals from Fort Bragg and Secret communiqués from the US Joint Chiefs of Staff .\nLest there be any doubt where the materials came from , they even discovered a video of Ali Mohammed ’ s lectures at the Kennedy Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg .\nBut those weren ’ t the only pieces of evidence that connected the Kahane assassination conspiracy—now commonly portrayed as the first act of Islamic terrorism on US soil—to Ali Mohammed , the remarkable CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant who , we are told , was “ Al Qaeda ’ s ” strangely untouchable “ triple agent ” in the heart of the American intelligence establishment .\nEl Sayyid Nosair himself—the 34-year old Egyptian-born janitor with a penchant for Prozac who quite literally got away with murder—was , as it turns out , not unknown to the authorities .\nIn fact , he had been known to the FBI since at least the previous summer .\nThat ’ s when , as it was later admitted , Nosair and a ragtag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a convoy of vehicles with semi-aututomatic weapons and copious amounts of ammo and heading to the Calverton Shooting Range on Long Island .\nFor four consecutive Sundays in July of 1989 , the FBI ’ s elite Special O perations Group—apparently tipped off that “ PLO terrorists were threatening to blow up casinos in Atlantic City ” —followed Nosair ’ s convoy to the shooting range , snapping dozens of photographs of the group engaging in target practice with handguns , rifles and even an AK-47 .\nThe group had set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qaeda ’ s New York office , which , as we have seen , not only operated in full view of the intelligence community but “ doubled as a recruiting post for the CIA seeking to steer fresh troops to the mujahideen ” in Afghanistan .\nAmong those in attendance at the FBI-surveilled target practice sessions : • Nosair himself , brandishing the chrome-plated .357 that he would later use to slay Kahane ; • Clement Rodney Hampton-El , an American-born black Muslim medical technician known as “ Dr .\nRashid ” who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; • Mahmud Abouhalima , known as “ the Red ” for his curly red hair , covered during the sessions by an NRA cap ; • Nidal Ayyad , a Kuwaiti who had taken classes to become a US citizen ; • and Mohammed Salameh , a Palestinian who grew up in Jordan and studied under Abdullah Azzam .\nNot present at those sessions in July , however , was the group ’ s trainer , Ali Mohammed , the remarkable Al Qaeda “ triple agent ” who had been taking weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the US Army ’ s Special Forces training center at Fort Bragg to instruct the Al Kifah cell in the techniques of guerrilla warfare , including bomb making and weapons handling .\nNosair and his fellow Al Kifah plotters had been under surveillance by the FBI .\nMohammed , their handler came straight from Fort Bragg , providing them with Top Secret government documents and personally overseeing their training .\nBut , incredibly , none of these points were raised at Nosair ’ s trial for the murder of Kahane .\nFBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bigger plot were ordered to stand down .\nAnd , according to the official history , the boxes of Arabic documents seized from Nosair ’ s house were not translated until years later .\nNosair ’ s not guilty verdict was cheered by his supporters , and the same cadre of Ali Mohammed-trained radicals who had been surveilled at the shooting range by the FBI moved on to plot their next spectacular terror attack : the bombing of the World Trade Center .\nAnd , as would be revealed in dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , too , had an FBI informant at its heart .\nWhen Emad Salem—a former lieutenant colonel in the Egyptian army who arrived in the United States in 1988—began working as an FBI asset , he was not originally assigned to infiltrate Islamic terror groups .\nNo , in 1988 the Cold War was still on and the FBI tasked Salem with penetrating KGB and Russian mafia rings operating in New York City .\nBut by 1991 , things had changed .\nWith the Cold War over , the Bureau ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handler , Nancy Floyd , who appreciated his work , thought the Egyptian informant ’ s background might make him useful to the FBI ’ s Joint Terrorism Task Force .\nSalem ’ s new handlers in the Bureau ’ s counterterror division , Louie Napoli and John Anticev , put him to work infiltrating the groups raising funds for international Islamic terror on US soil .\nHis first priority : insinuating himself into the ring around the Blind Sheikh , Omar Abel Rahman , including El Sayyid Nosair , then on trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Calverton shooting range associates .\nSalem was remarkably successful in his assignment .\nHaunting the trial of Nosair , he soon befriended Nosair ’ s cousin , Ibrahim el-Gabrowny .\nEl-Gabrowny immediately took to the affable Egyptian , introducing Salem to Nosair in jail and describing him as “ a new member of the family.\n” In a mere matter of weeks , Salem was caught on camera as one of Rahman ’ s bodyguards , even personally driving the Blind Sheikh to Detroit to deliver fundraising speeches .\nSoon thereafter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at his Brooklyn apartment .\nThere , after turning up the television in the dining room , explaining that he feared the apartment was bugged , el-Gabrowny sought to recruit Salem for a special mission .\nAt this early stage , the plot was less of a precise plan and more of a vague idea , devoid of details .\nEven the target of the proposed attack was undecided , with Salem being told that the group intended to set off bombs at twelve “ Jewish locations , ” including temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan .\nWithout knowing it and with hardly any effort , Salem had been recruited into an operation that would eventually result in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .\nSalem worked the plot as best he could , meeting more of the Calverton shooting range associates and gathering information from the cell members to pass along to the Bureau .\nAs the preparations for the bombing began to take shape , Salem ’ s role in the FBI sting operation seemed clear : he would lead the cell along , swapping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombs were placed .\nThen , when the cell was ready to strike , the FBI would swoop in and round up the plotters .\nBut that is not what happened .\nSalem ’ s remarkable success in infiltrating an active plot to stage terror attacks in New York—something that most FBI assets fail to accomplish in the course of their career— is , in retrospect , stunning .\nBut not as stunning as the FBI ’ s response to this incredible turn of events .\nAs author and journalist Peter Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel involved in the story , explained in his book , Triple Cross : But in June 1992 , Carson Dunbar—a rising young star in the FBI ’ s New York Office—was appointed to head the counterterror division .\nDunbar and his deputy , John Crouthamel , didn ’ t trust Salem .\nSoon they were trying to get him to submit to additional polygraphs and , eventually , they broke their deal with Salem and demanded he wear a wire .\nSalem refused and withdrew from the operation , shutting the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salem out of the picture , the Ali Mohammed-trained , Blind Sheikh-supported , Al Kifah-connected cell continued on with their plot .\nBut , with internal disputes disrupting their plans , they had to find someone else to actually build the bomb .\nThey found that person in Ramzi Yousef .\nTo this day , despite having been caught , tried and convicted for the World Trade Center bombing , little is known about Ramzi Yousef ’ s origins , or even his identity .\nThe 9/11 Commission—relying on the torture testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely as a “ Sunni extremist ” whose real name was Abdul Basit .\nBut this supposedly devout Muslim fundamentalist is reported to have hung out at karaoke bars and dated b-girls during his trips to the Philippines while his wife and daughters waited for him in Baluchistan .\nEven his birthplace remains a mystery .\nWhat is known is that Yousef learned bomb-making in Osama bin Laden ’ s training camps in Afghanistan in the early 1990s , perhaps from Ali Mohammed himself ; that in 1995 Newsday reported that the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA had any relationship with Yousef ; ” and that in 1999 Swiss journalist Richard Labeviere reported that a “ classified FBI file indicates that he was recruited by the local branch of the CIA.\n” And , like so many of the other key operatives in the Al Qaeda story , Yousef was able to avoid regular screening procedures , waltz across borders with forged travel documents and enter the United States without a visa .\nOn August 31 , 1992 , Yousef and Ahmad Ajaj—a fellow mujahideen who Yousef had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan—flew from Pakistan to the US despite lacking the proper travel documents to do so , a miraculous feat that the FBI has alleged was enabled by “ direct assistance from senior Pakistani intelligence officials.\n” Upon their arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on September 1st , both men were immediately detained by immigration officials .\nAjaj , acting “ loud and belligerent , ” was caught with a crudely forged Swedish passport and taken to a back office for questioning .\n“ The U.S. government was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment he stepped foot on U.S. soil , ” the Los Angeles Times later reported , noting that his suitcases were “ stuffed with fake passports , fake IDs and a cheat sheet on how to lie to U.S. immigration inspectors.\n” But that wasn ’ t all ; among his possessions , inspectors also found two handwritten notebooks filled with bomb recipes , six bomb-making guides that included pages from Fort Bragg military manuals , and four how-to videotapes concerning weaponry and surveillance training .\nAjaj was charged with passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison .\nYousef , meanwhile , tried a different approach .\nDressed in “ traditional peasant garb ” and carrying an Iraqi passport without a US visa , Yousef strode confidently up to the immigration inspector and declared himself to be a refugee seeking asylum from the oppressive Iraqi government , politely asking to be admitted into America .\nAfter being questioned and fingerprinted , one alert immigration official noted his links to Ajaj and sought to detain him , but “ there was not enough room in the INS lockup , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he show up at an asylum hearing later .\nYousef then left the airport , took a cab to New York ’ s East Village and immediately met with Mahmud Abouhalima , “ the Red , ” who had trained with Ali Mohammed and who had served as the getaway driver for Nosair before being waved away by the hotel doorman .\nYousef set about professionalizing the ragtag band of misfits , transforming their vague “ Jewish locations ” plot into an altogether more ambitious plan : to plant a bomb in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers of the World Trade Center , collapsing it into the other tower and killing tens of thousands in the process .\nHe got to work immediately , organizing the cell , renting a storage locker across the Hudson River in Jersey City and beginning the five month task of constructing the bomb .\nWithout Salem , the FBI ostensibly no longer had an asset in the cell to watch as the plot took shape .\nBut , if there had been a serious investigation underway , unraveling the cell and discovering their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ajaj , who had been caught with a raft of terrorist training materials and bomb-making guides , remained in contact without Yousef the whole time , speaking to him frequently via the prison phone .\nBut , although those calls were taped , no one from the FBI or any other agency monitored or even attempted to translate those phone calls until after the World Trade Center explosion the following February , and no one traced the pair ’ s flights back to discover that they had both boarded in Pakistan without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for the first leg of their journey to New York .\nSalem even tried one last time to warn the FBI about the cell .\nMeeting his old handler , Nancy Floyd , at a Subway sandwich shop near the FBI ’ s New York office in October of 1992 to collect his final $ 500 cash payment , he informed her that he had heard that the group was planning a new attack and begged her to put surveillance on Abouhalima and Salameh .\nBut it was no use .\nCarson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and all she could do was pass along the suggestion .\nSalem ’ s warning was ignored and no one followed up on the lead .\nThe FBI had followed the Al Kifah plotters to the shooting range , investigated their role in the Kahane murder , had an informant in their midst reporting on their plans for a spectacular terror attack and now another high-level terror operative had been allowed to enter the country and proceed with his activities unmolested , just as Ali Mohammed and the Blind Sheikh before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon on February 26 , 1993 , Ramzi Yousef and Eyad Ismoil , a Jordanian associate , drove a yellow Ryder van into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center , parking on the B-2 level .\nYousef ignited the 20-foot fuse and fled .\nTwelve minutes later , the bomb went off .\nThe bomb—cutting through the parking garage with an explosive force of 150,000 pounds per square inch— might have lacked the explosive force to fulfill Yousef ’ s goal of toppling the towers , but it did wreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand were injured and 50,000 were forced to evacuate the building in the chaotic aftermath of the explosion .\nLearning of the bombing , Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism expert working for the Rand Corporation , remarked : “ We may be talking about the opening salvo of a new conflict for a New World Order.\n” As the investigation into the bombing began , a letter arrived in the offices of various New York newspapers claiming responsibility for the attack .\nThe letter , sent under the name “ Liberation Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : end US aid to Israel , end diplomatic relations with Israel and stop interfering with the internal affairs of Middle Eastern nations .\nIf these demands were not met , the letter promised that 150 suicide soldiers would be ready to commit more attacks , including launching strikes on “ potential Nuclear targets.\n” If there was any doubt about who was behind the explosion , those doubts were quickly dispelled .\nJust two days into the investigation , in one of the FBI ’ s first descents into the pitch-black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast , an explosives enforcement officer from the ATF found the proverbial “ needle in the haystack “ : a part from the Ryder van itself bearing a Vehicle Identification Number .\nThe van rental was traced back to Mohammed Salameh , one of Ali Mohammed ’ s trainees from the Al Kifah center .\nAbsurdly , Salameh was apprehended on March 4 , one week after the bombing , when he returned to the Ryder rental office in Jersey City to reclaim the deposit on the van .\nSalameh ’ s arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of three others in the Al Kifah cell : Nidal Ayyad , Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj .\nIt also led investigators to the apartment of Ramzi Yousef .\nBut it was too late .\nRamzi Yousef had boarded a flight to Karachi the night of the bombing and then vanished , flying from country to country with impunity , plotting assassinations and bombings in Pakistan , Thailand , the Philippines and Iran , and concocting an elaborate plot called “ Bojinka ” to blow up a number of airliners in mid-flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 .\nBut it was not just Yousef himself—the mysteriously protected terror mastermind who had entered the US without a visa—who vanished .\nWhen Pakistani federal investigators later went to check their immigration records , they discovered that all of the documents pertaining to Yousef ’ s journey to the United States in 1992 , including his embarkation card , had “ mysteriously disappeared.\n” In the wake of the bombing , the FBI—now facing enormous public pressure to round up those involved and bust the terror cell that they had infiltrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Emad Salem .\nOnce again , Salem was able to quickly penetrate the Blind Sheikh ’ s cell and to begin working with them on a new scheme , the so-called “ landmarks ” plot to bomb key targets around New York City , including the UN headquarters , the Lincoln Tunnel and the George Washington Bridge .\nThis time , the FBI arrested the plotters before they could stage their attack .\nBut at the trial two years later , Salem had a surprise for the prosecution .\nHe had secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI handlers , conversations that revealed for the first time the FBI ’ s real role in the World Trade Center bombing .\nPredictably , in the wake of the blast , the debate began to center on the government ’ s “ mismanagement ” of the case .\nThe Blind Sheikh ’ s entry to the US had been a “ mistake.\n” The NYPD ’ s refusal to investigate Nosair ’ s accomplices in the killing of Kahane had just been a politically expedient omission .\nThe FBI having pulled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it developed into the World Trade Center bombing was simply “ incompetence.\n” The presence of a CIA-linked , Fort Bragg-stationed Green Beret in the midst of this radical terror cell was just an example of “ blowback.\n” And Ramzi Yousef ’ s miraculous ability to enter and leave countries at will without the proper documentation was just the result of bureaucratic bungling and overworked immigration officials .\nThe admissions of “ error ” and professions of “ blowback ” verged on admissions of guilt .\nEven the CIA—in an internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Kifah center ’ s operations—concluded that the agency itself was “ partly culpable ” for the World Trade Center bombing .\nBut the “ incompetence ” narrative soon arrived at its inevitable conclusion : the very agencies that had so signally “ bungled ” every step along this path were now to be given more money and bestowed more authority to conduct their “ counterterror ” operations .\nOthers proposed a less charitable reading of these events .\nRon Kuby , the lawyer who , along with William Kunstler , acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their accomplices—did not mince words in assigning blame for the World Trade Center bombing plot : Emad Salem himself summarized the story of the World Trade Center bombing in a phone call with his FBI handler , John Anticev , that was later released to the public .\nIf this pattern of “ missed opportunities ” and “ miraculous ” cross-border movements really had been the result of mere “ incompetence ” or “ inattentiveness , ” then the resources and attention that were thrown at the problem of international terrorism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing would have improved the intelligence agencies ’ record against their erstwhile foes .\nBut , remarkably , the scarcely believable trend of the early 1990s—that of intelligence agencies consistently “ missing ” the terrorists operating directly under their nose , border agents allowing known terrorists to pass from country to country unmolested and law enforcement officials letting these Al Qaeda-linked operatives off the hook—did not just continue into the late 1990s , the trend actually accelerated .\nAnd , as Al Qaeda went from a loose-knit group of a few dozen amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the premiere international terrorist organization at the end of the decade , the number of “ mistakes ” and “ missed opportunities ” multiplied from the merely unbelievable to the downright impossible .\nWhen Mahmud Abouhalima was arrested for his part in the World Trade Center plot in 1993 , he attempted to bargain with federal prosecutors .\nAbouhalima revealed the name of Wadih El-Hage—a Lebanese-born naturalized American citizen living in Texas who the Al Kifah cell had turned to for help in purchasing weapons—and recounted his experiences in Afghanistan with Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would later claim to have provided the rifles and rocket launchers that killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded 73 in Mogadishu in October of 1993 .\nAbouhalima then offered more information about the World Trade Center plot and his associates in exchange for a lighter sentence .\nProsecutors turned down the deal and failed to follow up on either El-Hage or Odeh .\nAli Mohamed , meanwhile , continued in his remarkably successful mission to infiltrate the intelligence arms of the US government .\nAfter having worked for the CIA and served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his next target was the FBI .\nFollowing his honourable discharge from the Army , Mohamed returned to his wife in California and applied to be a translator for the Bureau .\nHe was turned down for the position ; instead , he was asked to work as an FBI informant in a local document forgery ring .\nIn 1992 , the Bureau—evidently impressed with Mohamed ’ s work— “ opened ” him as a Foreign Counter Intelligence agent and tasked him with gaining intelligence on a San Jose mosque .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routine steps like administering a polygraph were never taken .\nAs a retired special agent who worked in the FBI ’ s New York Office later told journalist Peter Lance : “ One of the most unbelievable aspects of the Ali Mohamed story is that the Bureau could be dealing with this guy and they didn ’ t put him on the box .\nThe first thing you do with any kind of asset or informant is you polygraph him and if the relationship continues , you make him submit to continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic principle of running informants.\n” Still , despite repeatedly traveling back and forth to and from the Middle East throughout the period , Mohamed remained untouchable by law enforcement and border security .\nIn 1992 , he was detained in Rome when he was discovered with a Coca-Cola can containing a secret storage compartment .\nMohamed convinced the airport security that he was a security agent for the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and was released with a warning that if anything happened on the flight , he would be blamed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the US on forged documents for a fundraising tour , Mohamed traveled to Vancouver , Canada to help an associate of Zawahiri , Essam Marzouk , enter the country .\nMarzouk , caught with forged Saudi passports by Canadian customs officials , was detained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .\nWhen Mohamed arrived inquiring about his friend , he was detained by the RCMP as well .\nAfter hours of interrogation , he told them he was an FBI asset , giving them the phone number of his handler , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough .\nThe RCMP let Mohamed go .\nMohamed ’ s travels during this busy period included a trip to Afghanistan in the summer of 1991 to help Osama bin Laden and his fledgling Al Qaeda organization relocate to Sudan .\nOsama ’ s move to Sudan came at a time when , we are told , the wealthy Saudi was looking to cement his reputation as a holy warrior .\nThe official story of Al Qaeda holds that during this period , Bin Laden returned briefly to Saudi Arabia but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite US soldiers onto Saudi soil for the Gulf War , left the country for good .\nSearching for a place to move his operations , his gaze turned across the Red Sea to Sudan , where , as luck would have it , hardline Islamic extremist Hassan al-Turabi had come to power in a military coup just as the war was ending in Afghanistan .\nHeading the National Islamic Front Party , which sought to impose sharia law in the country , al-Turabi traveled to London for a meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention to allow Sudan to act as a base for Islamist terror groups .\nBy the summer of 1991 , Osama Bin Laden had answered that call , moving his fighters and equipment from the outskirts of Afghanistan to his new base in Sudan with the help of FBI asset Ali Mohamed .\nTurabi was not the only one traveling to London to foster his terror plans , however .\nIn between Bin Laden ’ s work establishing himself as a businessman in Sudan—using $ 12 million granted him by the Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commercial enterprises in the country , from a construction company to an investment firm to a trucking business to a tannery , a bakery , a furniture-making business and even a commercial farm employing four thousand labourers—the budding terror mastermind was , according to numerous sources , shuttling back and forth between Khartoum , Karachi and London .\nOsama Bin Laden ’ s visits to the UK in the early 1990s include an alleged stay at the London estate of Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz , a meeting in Manchester with representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later accused of being infiltrated by government moles and used to launch a series of false flag attacks in France , a period of several months in 1994 when he actually lived in the UK , allegedly buying a house in Wembley through an intermediate , and , even more explosively , a 1996 trip to his London press office which was—according to Swiss journalist Richard Labeviere , citing “ several Arab diplomatic sources ” — ” clearly under the protection of the British authorities.\n” Although the official story holds that Bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blip on the US intelligence community ’ s radar , this is contradicted by numerous lines of evidence .\nAli Mohamed , for instance , had “ volunteered the earliest insider description of al Qaeda that is publicly known ” to the FBI in 1993 , telling them that Bin Laden was “ building an army ” to overthrow the Saudi government and admitting that he had personally trained terrorists at the camps in Afghanistan and Sudan .\nBut the FBI , according to the Wall Street Journal , was “ flummoxed ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act on it .\nThis “ news ” about Al Qaeda ’ s activities would not have been news to the US government ’ s main intelligence agencies , however .\nIt was later revealed that , despite claims that the US government was only dimly aware of Bin Laden at this point , he was in fact already under extensive electronic surveillance .\nHaving obtained his voiceprint from recordings of his anti-Saddam speeches in Saudi Arabia , the NSA and CIA were already using signals intelligence to identify and monitor Bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell phone traffic .\nIn another key contradiction that is never addressed by the purveyors of the official Al Qaeda story , it was during this period that Osama Bin Laden—making trips to the UK under the alleged protection of British authorities and while admittedly under surveillance by American intelligence—began the streak of increasingly brazen terror attacks that , we are told , would end up in 9/11 .\nIn 1992 , Al Qaeda mounted their first terror operation against an American target .\nIn December of that year , bombs went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was believed , American servicemen were being quartered on their way to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope .\nThe attack killed an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker , but no Americans ; the troops had been staying at a different hotel .\nOsama only claimed responsibility for the bombing six years later .\nIn 1993 , eighteen American soldiers were killed and 73 wounded in Mogadishu during an intense two-day firefight that resulted in the downing of two Black Hawk helicopters by rocket-propelled grenades .\nIt wasn ’ t until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2004 , however , that the commission—citing “ new information ” received by “ the intelligence community ” in “ 1996—1997″—told the public that Al Qaeda had had a role in the incident .\nThe burnishing of Bin Laden ’ s terrorist credentials by the US government continued in 1996 .\nIn January of that year , the CIA officially opened “ Alec Station , ” a so-called virtual station dedicated solely to tracking Osama Bin Laden and his associates .\nHeaded at first by Michael Scheuer—an analyst at the CIA ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special interest in the Saudi exile—and named after Scheuer ’ s son , Alec Station soon became the hub for a mostly-female group of analysts who dubbed themselves “ the Manson Family ” because “ they had acquired a reputation for crazed alarmism about the rising al-Qaeda threat.\n” 1996 was also the year that the US government began putting diplomatic pressure on Sudan to hand over their files on Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda operatives .\nThe secret negotiations between the two countries culminated with Elfatih Erwa , Sudan ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying from Khartoum to Washington .\nThere , Erwa made a stunning offer : not to turn over the Sudanese government ’ s records on Bin Laden , but to turn over Bin Laden himself .\nWashington rejected the offer because , The Village Voice later reported , “ the FBI did not believe it had sufficient evidence to try Bin Laden in a US court.\n” Instead , they demanded that Sudan expel the supposed arch-terrorist to “ any other country except Somalia.\n” Sudan complied , protesting that Osama would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for Washington to negotiate with .\n“ We told him Sudan is no longer safe for him and creates problems for us and asked him to leave , ” Erwa told The Village Voice .\nIn June of 1996 , a truck bomb exploded outside of the Khobar Towers in Dhahran , Saudi Arabia .\nThe facility—located in the heart of the Saudi oil industry ’ s administrative area , where the US had built its first air base and where Standard Oil first struck oil in the country , establishing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied forces involved in enforcing the Iraqi no-fly zones .\nThe massive blast left an 85-foot crater , killing 19 and injuring hundreds .\nAt the time , the US blamed Tehran for the bombing , with Clinton ’ s Defense Secretary William Perry later admitting that there was a contingency plan in place to attack Iran if the link had been proven .\nBut by 2007 , Perry had changed his assessment : One thing is for certain : in 1998 , the $ 150 million contract to rebuild the Khobar Towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAll of these incidents helped to raise Bin Ladens profile in the intelligence community , but it was a series of events in 1998 that introduced the broader public to Osama Bin Laden .\nIn February of that year , Bin Laden—following up on a declaration of war against America that he had made to CNN ’ s TV cameras in an interview with Peter Bergen the previous year—issued his fatwa calling on Muslims to kill Americans : In May of that year , John Miller—then reporting for ABC News , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief spokesman—traveled to Afghanistan for a dramatic Nightline report on “ The Most Dangerous Man You ’ ve Never Heard Of ” that would air on ABC the following month : And , in August of 1998 , the name of Osama Bin Laden , terror mastermind , and his shadowy terror group , Al Qaeda , finally exploded into the public consciousness .\nOn the morning of August 7 , 1998 , two Saudis in Kenya—Mohammed al- ‘ Owhali and “ Jihad Ali ” Azzam , both of whom had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osama Bin Laden earlier that year—loaded some boxes into their Toyota cargo truck and headed off to the American embassy in downtown Nairobi .\nThe boxes contained two thousand pounds of TNT , aluminum nitrate and aluminum powder .\nAt the same time , Hamden Khalif Allah Awad—an Egyptian known as “ Ahmed the German ” for his fair hair—loaded a similar bomb into a gasoline truck in Tanzania and set off for the American embassy in Dar es Salaam .\nThe Saudis arrived at the Nairobi embassy at 10:30 AM .\n‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it approached the gates , demanding that the security guard raise the drop bar protecting the entrance .\nThe guard refused .\n‘ Owhali threw a stun grenade into the courtyard and ran and then the bomb went off .\nThe blast ripped the face off of the embassy building , collapsing a nearby secretarial college and lighting the tar-covered street and a nearby bus on fire .\n213 were dead and 4,500 injured .\nNine minutes later , Ahmed the German parked the gasoline truck in the parking lot of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bomb .\nHe had parked next to a water tanker truck , which ended up absorbing much of the blast , but the building was still badly damaged .\n11 were dead and 85 injured .\nThe message was clear and was dutifully broadcast by media around the world : A “ new ” terror group had conducted a sophisticated , coordinated attack against multiple US targets overseas and its leader was waging holy war against Americans .\nAl Qaeda had arrived .\nBut , like so many events in the Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bore the fingerprints of American intelligence on each stage of its development and execution .\nThe attacks , prosecutors later discovered , were being planned as far back as 1993 , when Osama Bin Laden sent his FBI/CIA/Green Beret triple agent extraordinaire , Ali Mohamed “ to survey potential U.S. , British , French and Israeli targets in Nairobi.\n” According to Mohamed ’ s own testimony : Joining Mohamed on the scouting mission was Anas al Liby , a member of a Libyan Al Qaeda cell known as al-Muqatila .\nDescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qaeda ’ s hierarchy , ” not only was al-Liby personally trained by Mohamed at the Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan , he was also a protected British intelligence asset .\nAl-Liby applied for asylum in Britain in 1995 , claiming to be a political enemy of the Libyan government .\nBut , as The Guardian later reported : Even more incredibly , not only did the British government grant that asylum , they then recruited al-Liby for a failed MI6 operation to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 1996 , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country even after the embassy bombing before ultimately letting him escape .\nAccording to FBI investigator Ali Soufan , the Manchester raid didn ’ t just nab a “ manual for jihad ; ” it caught al-Liby himself .\nAs Soufan recounts in his book , The Black Banners , the British police let al-Liby go when he denied being a terrorist .\nHe evaded the team that was sent to follow him and fled the country , eventually ending up on the US government ’ s most wanted list with a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet another important figure in the bombing who was well-known to American intelligence was Wadih El-Hage , the naturalized American citizen who had assisted the Al Kifah plotters and who Mahmud Abouhalima had identified to prosecutors after his arrest for the World Trade Center bombing .\nAs was later revealed , US intelligence had El-Hage under surveillance during the entire period that the embassy bombing plot was being hatched , but once again merely watched as the attack unfolded .\nAs The Los Angeles Times detailed : Author Simon Reeve revealed even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot in his 1999 book , The New Jackals .\n“ The CIA also had informants working within the east Africa cell , ” he reported , citing an interview with a CIA official , “ but they apparently failed to warn of Bin Laden ’ s plans.\n” Even if the CIA ’ s sources within the plot had somehow “ failed ” to warn them of the attack , the fact that multiple members of the cell under their surveillance—including Abdullah Ahmed Abdulah , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , Usama al-Kini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled Kenya for Pakistan the night before the bombing would have instantly raised alarm bells if the agencies ’ intention had been to prevent an attack .\nInstead , the plotters conspired with CIA informants in their midst and the attacks went ahead under the watchful eye of CIA , NSA and FBI surveillance .\nHowever they transpired , the bombings succeeded in introducing Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda to the world stage .\nDespite the years of intelligence agency surveillance and even the creation of a virtual CIA station dedicated solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bin Laden and his network , it wasn ’ t until after the embassy bombings that the world at large began to hear the name of Osama Bin Laden .\nOn August 20th—three weeks after the bombing and just three days after being publicly interrogated about the Monica Lewinsky affair—President Clinton ordered a missile strike on alleged Al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan and Sudan , boldly proclaiming that actions against Bin Laden and international terror had become a new mission for the US military .\nThe strike , however—a barrage of 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s camp in Khost , Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant thought to be manufacturing chemical weapons in Khartoum—was a spectacular failure on almost every level .\nNeither Bin Laden nor Zawahiri were killed in the attacks and the “ chemical weapons ” plant in Khartoum had nothing to do with either Bin Laden or chemical weapons , but was in fact manufacturing much-needed medicines for the region .\nThe plant ’ s destruction—in the estimation of Werner Daum , then Germany ’ s ambassador to Sudan—led to “ several tens of thousands ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Zawahiri , Bin Laden ’ s long-time associate and future leader of Al Qaeda , was on one of Bin Laden ’ s monitored satellite phones at the time of the attack , telling BBC journalist Rahumullah Yusufzai that “ Bin Laden has a message .\nHe says , ‘ I have not bombed the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .\nI have declared jihad , but I was not involved . '\n” Zawahiri ’ s exact position would have been immediately detectable by American surveillance aircraft in the region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called “ inexplicable ” —the aircraft were not available prior to the strike and Zawahiri escaped unscathed .\nBin Laden , meanwhile , was—according to CIA intelligence gleaned from intercepted satellite calls—going to be at his training camp in Khost the day of the missile strike .\nBut he was not .\nHe was , Clinton counter-terror czar Richard Clarke later speculated , tipped off about the attack by “ a retired head of the ISI , ” Pakistan ’ s intelligence service that had long been known as an adjunct of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two key respects , however : they kept Clinton ’ s personal dalliances in the Oval Office from leading America ’ s nightly news broadcasts for at least one news cycle and they reinforced the importance of the new threat to global security : Osama Bin Laden .\nThis “ new threat ” provided a green light for the American security establishment and its allies around the world to ramp up operations in the name of fighting the Al Qaeda menace .\nThe FBI began an international investigation of the bombing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting on terror threats that counter-terror officials later complained overwhelmed the system and diverted attention and resources , and in November of 1998 the United States Federal Court finally issued its first public indictment of Osama Bin laden .\nThe first international arrest warrant for Bin Laden—a confidential document intended only for police and judicial authorities—had in fact already been issued in April of that year , but it was not issued by the US .\nInstead , it was the Libyan government that had issued the warrant through Interpol .\nThey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the murder of two German intelligence agents in Libya in 1994 .\nAt the time , despite publicly recognizing Bin Laden as the premier financier of international terrorism , the US and British governments downplayed the document , even making sure to scrub the charges against Osama and any mention of Libya ’ s role in issuing the document from the public record .\nBut this surge in activity around the Al Qaeda threat resulted in at least one surprising development .\nIn one of the most consequential and underreported moves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally arrested .\nContacted in the days after the bombing , Mohamed admitted to FBI agents that he knew who had carried out the attack but would not give the government the names .\nSubpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in the Southern District of New York , he was finally arrested , although even the charges against him were kept secret from the public .\nOn October 20 , 2000 , Mohamed pled guilty to involvement in the embassy bombings , but he was never sentenced .\nHe then disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later reported as “ protective custody.\n” To this day , there is no public record of Ali Mohamed—the ex-US Sergeant and FBI asset who admitted to his key role in Al Qaeda—ever being sentenced .\nThere is no public record of his incarceration .\nAnd there are only a handful of accounts that have ever surfaced from people who talked to him in prison in the aftermath of 9/11 .\nAnd , just like that , one of the deepest mysteries of the Al Qaeda story disappeared from public sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite all this increased activity , the same pattern of “ oversights ” and “ mistakes ” by the intelligence agencies continued unabated .\nOn October 12 , 2000 , when a small fiberglass fishing boat approached the massive , 8,300 ton USS Cole—a billion dollar guided-missile destroyer employing the latest stealth technology and armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles , anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and a five-inch canon—the sailors onboard watched in amusement .\nThe tiny skiff stopped amidships and two men stood up , waving and smiling .\nThen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying over 400 pounds of C4 explosive molded into a shaped charge .\nThe explosion was immense , knocking over cars passing by onshore .\nIn the city , miles away , people believed there was an earthquake taking place .\nThe blast tore a hole forty feet by forty feet in the hull of the Cole , killing 17 US servicemen and injuring thirty-nine more .\nIt was the deadliest attack on a US destroyer in over a decade .\nBut this attack , like all of Al Qaeda ’ s spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded by a string of “ missed opportunities ” and “ unheeded warnings.\n” Not only was there there intelligence about a potential attack on a US naval ship from several different sources—including reports from multiple informants and intercepted phone calls to Al Qaeda ’ s NSA-monitored Yemen communications hub—but , as Congressman Curt Weldon revealed in 2005 , a secret military intelligence operation codenamed Able Danger actually warned the Pentagon days before the bombing that an attack was going to take place in Yemen .\nBut even after the spectacular “ failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack , and despite President Clinton ’ s assurance that he would find and retaliate against the bomb plotters .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nthe CIA repeatedly denied FBI investigators access to key information about the plot .\nBut , it turns out , the CIA did have such information .\nAnd that information—deliberately withheld from the FBI or any other investigative agency—led directly into the heart of the operation behind the next spectacular terror attack to be blamed on Al Qaeda : 9/11 .\nFrom the beginning , 9/11 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case .\nOsama Bin Laden ’ s name was raised on air by the TV news anchors within seconds of the second plane strike and was endlessly repeated in the hours and days that followed .\nBy the end of the week , the public was convinced that the events were the work of Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda and all of the subsequent “ investigations ” and commissions only served to bolster that pre-formed conclusion .\nSo it was no surprise at all when , on September 14 , 2001 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijackers , Muslims with Arabic names who , we were told , had been sent by Bin Laden on a suicide mission .\nBut who were these men ?\nFor the general public , the newscasters ’ solemn intonation that the nineteen hijackers had been identified , followed by a mugshot-like line up of photographs , was all that was needed to cement the case in their minds .\nThose who required more detail turned to made-for-TV dramas and documentaries to learn about the so-called “ Hamburg cell ” of radicalized Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziad Jarrah and Marwan al-Shehhi , three of the alleged suicide pilots .\nFinally , the 9/11 Commission and its associated monographs—like the staff report on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel—attempted to fill in the paper trail for researchers concerned about the documentary record of these men , including their motivations and their movement .\nFrom these accounts , a picture emerged .\nThese nineteen terrorists , crack operatives hand-picked by Osama Bin Laden and trained in his terror camps in Afghanistan , had used their carefully honed spycraft to slip into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as they trained at flight schools in the US and finalized the operational details of their plan .\nThen , after years of meticulous preparation , these men , consumed by their hatred of the West , their love of Allah and their devotion to Bin Laden—deftly piloted their planes into their targets , wreaking havoc and devastation exactly as planned .\nBut this story , too , is a carefully constructed lie , every part of which falls apart under sustained scrutiny .\nIn the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims that they were willing to give their lives for the cause .\nMarwan al-Shehhi , we were told , was so devoted to his religious beliefs that he observed the Ramadan fast against medical advice after a stomach operation , causing him to fall severely ill. Ziad Jarrah , meanwhile , “ initially caroused and smoked ” during his early days in Hamburg but “ then grew intensely religious and withdrawn.\n” And , according to award-winning journalist Lawrence Wright , Mohammed Atta ’ s “ extreme rigidity of character ” made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly demonstrated an aversion to women.\n” When reporters began following the trail that these supposed suicide soldiers had left behind , however , they began to uncover an altogether different story .\nAtta and his associates frequented strip clubs in San Diego , Las Vegas and Daytona Beach , where they drank alcohol and ordered lap dances .\nThey hung out for days at a time at Harry ’ s Bar in New York , where Atta preferred a table near the piano .\nAnd , three nights before the attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar in Fort Lauderdale , where , according to bar manager Tony Amos , they consumed several drinks , became drunk and gave the bartender a hard time about the bill .\n“ The guy Mohamed was drunk , his voice was slurred and he had a thick accent , ” Amos told the Associated Press the day after 9/11 .\nEven the New York Times reported on Atta and al-Shehhi ’ s “ high life ” during multiple visits to the Philippines between 1998 and 2000 , where the pair of strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and their girlfriends flashed money , drank and partied regularly .\n“ Many times I saw him let a girl go at the gate in the morning , ” the Times quoted one hotel chambermaid as recalling about Atta .\n“ It was always a different girl.\n” And , during his research for Welcome to Terrorland—an investigation into the Venice , Florida flight schools where Mohammed Atta , Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah were enrolled in the year 2000—Daniel Hopsicker interviewed Amanda Keller , a former stripper who claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in Venice and who shared more stories about the partying of these alleged jihadis .\nBut Hopsicker ’ s investigation uncovered more than just the alleged hijacker ’ s trail of booze , drugs and women .\nHe also became one of the only reporters to look into the strange connections of Huffman Aviation and the Florida Flight Training Center in Venice , Florida , where Atta , al-Shehhi and Jarrah trained the year before September 11th .\nHuffman Aviation was also the flight school that Yeslam Bin Laden , Osama ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of his acquaintances .\nThe flight school was run by Rudi Dekkers , a Dutch native who was running a commuter airline with Wally Hilliard .\nHilliard—the founder and former president of a Green Bay , Wisconsin-based insurance company—made news in October 2000 when his personal jet was found to be transporting 42 pounds of heroin and was seized by federal agents in what was called the biggest drug bust in central Florida history .\nBut Hilliard ’ s charter airline start-up had high-level political support : Jeb Bush , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ops in support of Hilliard ’ s airline .\nDekkers , meanwhile , was arrested in 2012 , having told an undercover agent—in the words of the criminal complaint against him—that he was “ involved in narcotics transportation via private aircraft and that he has flown narcotics and U.S. currency previously without any problems.\n” He was carrying over 18 kilograms of cocaine and nearly one kilogram of heroin at the time of his arrest .\nDespite the many questions that still hang over the alleged hijackers ’ activities in Venice and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegedly taking place at the Venice airport , an even deeper question was soon to emerge : How did these pilots—who were rated as competent at best and who , one instructor insisted , should have been further along the flight school curriculum than they were—manage to fly jumbo jets that require thousands of hours of flying experience with such precision ?\nThat question is even more important in the case of the other alleged 9/11 pilot , Hani Hanjour , the diminutive 5 foot 5 inch Saudi who , the official story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top Gun honor graduate Chuck Burlingame and his flight crew at the controls of American Airlines Flight 77 .\nAccording to that story , Hanjour allegedly flew a Boeing 757 with what aviation sources for The Washington Post described as “ extraordinary skill ” through a seven thousand foot spiral descent to hit the Pentagon , a move that veteran airline pilot Ed Soliday told the 9/11 Commission would be “ tough for any airline pilot , including himself , ” and which left one radar operator at Dulles Airport stunned : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that he turned , we all thought in the radar room , all of us experienced air traffic controllers , that that was a military plane.\n” But Hanjour , by all accounts , was a completely inept pilot .\nHe dropped out of his first flight school , the Sierra Academy of Aeronautics , after only a few classes .\nHe then dropped out of his next school , Cockpit Resource Management in Scottsdale , Arizona , after the school ’ s owner dismissed him as a “ weak student ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he returned to that school again the following year , the school owner refused , asserting : “ You ’ re never going to make it.\n” An instructor at his next school , Sawyer Aviation , called him a “ neophyte ” who “ got overwhelmed with the instruments ” in the school ’ s flight simulator .\nAn instructor at his next school concurred : Hanjour had “ no motivation , a poor understanding of the basic principles of aviation , and poor judgment , combined with poor technical skills.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial pilot ’ s license from a for-profit contractor , the operation manager at yet another flight school in the Phoenix area , Peggy Chevrette , told Fox News that Hanjour was clearly unqualified to be in the cockpit : “ I couldn ’ t believe that he had a license of any kind with the skills that he had.\n” Even The New York Times conceded that the remarkable flight attributed to Hanjour on 9/11 was inexplicable .\nIn an article headlined “ A Trainee Noted For Incompetence , ” the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew Hanjour as saying : ” I ’ m still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon .\nHe could not fly at all.\n” Whatever the case , what would eventually become the official explanation for this seeming incongruity—namely , that the single engine aircraft training and jet simulation training that they had received was good enough for these men to jump into the cockpit of commercial jet airliners and pilot them hundreds of miles to their targets—was rejected in the first hours of the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of September 15 , 2001 , provided one potential answer to this puzzle .\nAccording to a “ high-ranking US Navy source ” cited by the report , “ [ t ] hree of the alleged hijackers listed their address on drivers licenses and car registrations as the Naval Air Station in Pensacola ” and , according to a separate “ high-ranking Pentagon official , ” another of the alleged hijackers “ may have received language instruction at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.\n” But this report—like the subsequent reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged hijackers turning up alive and well in the wake of 9/11 , which prompted the FBI to apologize to one mistakenly named suspect and forced FBI Director Robert Mueller to acknowledge that they were not certain of the identities of several of the named men—were eventually dismissed as mere confusion over common Arab names .\nOn September 28 , 2001 , the FBI released the final list of names and photographs of the alleged hijackers and this rogues ’ gallery of fearsome Al Qaeda operatives was cemented in the public imagination .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they really were who the FBI said they were , who directed them ?\nHow were they supposed to have entered the United States ?\nHow did they fund their operations ?\nAnd how did they evade detection while living openly in the US for months and in some cases years ?\nIn the months after the attacks , we were told that the men identified by the FBI as the culprits had “ moved through Europe and America unnoticed ” and that although several of them “ had been tracked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , ” they were ultimately “ lost.\n” We were told that Al Qaeda ’ s communications had been monitored , but that Bin Laden and his henchman used “ scramblers , Internet encryption , fiber optics ” so it was “ very hard ” to intercept those transmissions .\nAnd we were told that no one was to blame for the attacks , which had merely been a “ failure of imagination.\n” But , as the public was to learn in bits and pieces over the course of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions was a demonstrable lie .\nThis alleged team of crack Al Qaeda operatives did not “ move through Europe and America unnoticed.\n” Their communications were not rendered opaque to the intelligence agencies because of “ fiber optics.\n” Their successful penetration of America ’ s defenses was not due to a “ failure of imagination.\n” Instead—as even the official story of the attacks now concedes—every major branch of US intelligence had key pieces of information on these Al Qaeda operatives , their communications , their movements and their plans .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown from official sources , these agencies not only deliberately allowed these operatives to proceed unmolested but actively stopped investigators and agents within their ranks from blowing the whistle on the plot .\nAt the FBI , Special Agent Robert Wright led an investigation into terrorist financing called Vulgar Betrayal that managed to uncover a money trail connecting a suspected Chicago terror cell to Al Qaeda .\nBut when Wright attempted to bring criminal charges against the cell ’ s members , his supervisor flew into a rage , shouting : “ You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid any of you .\nYou will not open criminal investigations against any of these intelligence subjects.\n” After the embassy bombings , when Wright ’ s team began to trace the financing of the attacks to a group of Saudi businessmen , the FBI moved to shut down the investigation altogether .\nWright was kicked off the case in 1999 and Vulgar Betrayal was officially shut down in 2000 .\nWhile Wright was pursuing the financial trail , FBI field agents across the US were picking up on another trend : Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma and Phoenix both wrote memos about the “ large numbers of Middle Eastern males receiving flight training ” and warned that some of them had documentable ties to Al Qaeda , but the warnings were ignored .\nAgents in Minneapolis frantically sought approval for a search warrant to search the laptop of Zaccarias Moussaoui , a suspected terrorist who had been receiving flight training in the area .\nWhen that request was denied , one exasperated agent told FBI headquarters that he was “ trying to keep someone from taking a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Rita Flack , an intelligence opearations specialist at headquarters who had read the Phoenix memo , failed to pass that info on to any of her colleagues involved in the decision to deny the warrant to search Moussaoi ’ s laptop .\nFBI whistleblower Colleen Rowley later revealed that agents in the Minneapolis office—desperately trying to find an answer to the question of why the Bureau was deliberately sabotaging the case—faced the problem with gallows humour : “ I know I shouldn ’ t be flippant about this , but jokes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be spies or moles , like Robert Hansen , who were actually working for Osama Bin Laden to have so undercut Minneapolis ’ effort.\n” The Pentagon ’ s intelligence branch , meanwhile , not only had foreknowledge of the plot , but—according to information that emerged years later and was quickly suppressed—had identified four of the presumed terror operatives and mapped out the network connecting them to the Brooklyn cell headed by the Blind Sheikh .\n“ Able Danger ” was a classified information operations campaign against transnational terrorism launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 .\nFirst revealed to the public in June 2005 , Able Danger employed data mining techniques on open source and classified information to identify networks of likely terror agents , including those operating in the US .\nThe program was remarkably successful : not only did it warn the Pentagon of an impending attack just days before the Cole bombing , as we have already seen , but , according to Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) whistleblower Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer and four of his colleagues working on the operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells connecting Al Qaeda to the alleged hijackers .\nIt even identified four of those suspects—including Mohamed Atta—by name .\nWhen Lt. Col. Shaffer tried to set up a meeting between his supervisor and FBI officials in Washington to discuss a collaborative approach to tracking these cells , he was rebuffed by lawyers for the Pentagon ’ s Special Operations Command .\nShortly thereafter , Shaffer was ordered off the Able Danger team and the unit was disbanded , with the Pentagon ordering all the Able Danger data—2.5 terabytes worth of information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed material in the Library of Congress—destroyed .\nAfter a hostile investigation that left witnesses feeling intimidated into changing their story about Able Danger still found five Pentagon employees who said they had seen the organizational chart with Atta ’ s name on it , the Department of Defense Inspector General concluded that Able Danger had never identified Atta or any other alleged hijacker .\nAnd , just two months after the story became public—including Shaffer ’ s revelation that he had met with 9/11 Commission Executive Director Philip Zelikow and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an extensive hour-long debriefing in Afghanistan that did not find its way into the Commission ’ s final report—the DIA stripped Shaffer of his security clearance , essentially ending his decades-long career as a military intelligence officer .\nThe NSA , meanwhile—despite the “ scrambler and fiber optics ” excuses of the agency ’ s apologists—were monitoring all of the communications going through Al Qaeda ’ s pivotal Yemen communications hub from the lead-up to the Embassy bombings straight through to the execution of 9/11 itself .\nThis “ communications hub ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping into and transcribing the satellite phone calls of Bin Laden—was , in fact , the home of Ahmed al-Hada , one of the jihadis who had fought alongside Bin Laden against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s .\nHada ’ s phone was used by various Al Qaeda-linked operatives to pass messages to each other , as some countries blocked or monitored calls to other countries as possible terrorist communications .\nThe NSA listened as Mohamed al-Owhali , one of the bombers involved in the embassy attack , made multiple calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack .\nThey listened as Al Qaeda operatives called the hub to discuss attacking a US warship in the months prior to the Cole bombing .\nAnd they listened as numerous terror suspects called to discuss their operations with Khalid al-Mihdhar , one of the alleged 9/11 hijackers and the son-in-law of Ahmed al-Hada .\nThomas Drake was a decorated United States Air Force and United States Navy veteran with a background in military crypto-electronics who had worked for twelve years as an outside contractor at the NSA .\n9/11 was his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , and it was in the wake of that attack that he was handed a report from one of his colleagues in the NSA ’ s “ CounterTerror Shop ” that laid out the agency ’ s role in the events of that day .\nAccording to Drake , the report was “ an extraordinarily detailed long-term study of Al Qaeda ’ s activities ” that identified “ the planning cells ” for 9/11 , including “ a number of the hijackers based on actual copy : Atta , Hazmi , Mihdhar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the NSA ’ s radar by the start of 2001 .\nIt also contained specific warnings about 9/11 .\nDrake immediately gave the document to his supervisor , Maureen Baginski , who told him : “ Tom , I wish you had not brought this to my attention.\n” He was subsequently forced out of his position , stripped of his security clearance and indicted under the Espionage Act .\nOn the day of the attacks , knowing the information that the NSA had that could have foiled the plot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffers suffered heart attacks , with one dying .\nAnother , a female analyst who had been responsible for monitoring the Yemen hub communications , left NSA headquarters after suffering what Drake was told was a nervous breakdown .\nYet another , a 40-something man , began openly crying in a hallway , telling three women he was talking to in full view of everyone passing : “ We knew this was being planned months ago , but they would not let us issue the reports we wrote.\n” NSA leadership , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the SIGINT division , Maureen Baginski , had a different reaction to the events unfolding that morning .\nIn fact , the story of intelligence agency foreknowledge of the plot goes from the merely impossible to the outright absurd when it is revealed that it wasn ’ t just US intelligence that had a window into the plot , but every major intelligence service in the world .\nIn subsequent years , it has emerged that intelligence agencies in Indonesia , the UK , Germany , Italy , Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , Israel had all passed on various warnings about an imminent attack in the months and years leading up to 9/11 .\nAnd , infamously , the President received a classified intelligence briefing on August 6 , 2001 , that unequivocally stated that an attack was being prepared .\nIt ’ s no surprise that this plot—the most important ever attempted by Al Qaeda—would have been known by so many .\nNot only did the men that ( we are told ) bin Laden hand-picked for the operation make no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , they instead—in the words of some investigators—left a deliberate trail behind them , a trail that was picked up and extensively reported on in the immediate wake of the attacks .\nPerhaps the greatest clue as to the real nature of the 9/11 operation , however , is found in one of the most stunning pieces of evidence of direct intelligence agency complicity in the plot .\nIn the years after the attack , it was revealed that the CIA were not just surveilling the supposed hijackers or gathering information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these men ’ s travels from reaching other intelligence agencies , deliberately hiding the fact that two of these agents had entered the US and were openly living in the country from the FBI and even from the National Security Council itself for over one and a half years .\nThis incredible fact , buried in footnote 44 of chapter 6 of the 9/11 Commission report , was no trivial detail .\n9/11 Commission chair Thomas Kean called it “ one of the most troubling aspects of our entire report.\n” White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evidence of both CIA malfeasance and misfeasance .\nAnd Mark Rossini , an FBI agent assigned to the CIA ’ s Bin Laden unit , believed it to be part of a secret intelligence operation involving these supposed terrorist hijackers that the agency didn ’ t want anyone to discover .\nShortly after the Cole bombing , Fahad al-Quso , a Yemeni with known links to Osama Bin Laden , was interrogated by Yemeni agents and admitted that he had flown from Yemen to Bangkok the previous January to deliver $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrorist based in Malaysia who Quso identified as the bombing mastermind .\nThe money , Quso said , was to buy this one-legged terror mastermind an artificial leg .\nBut Ali Soufan—the head of the FBI investigation into the Cole bombing—was puzzled by this lead .\nWhy was Al Qaeda transferring money out of Yemen when they were supposedly planning an attack in that country ?\nWas this money for a different operation ?\nAs with every such lead , Soufan followed up with an official request to the CIA for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Malaysia or the phone number that Quso had used to contact him there .\nThe CIA never responded to any of these official requests .\nOn December 29 , 1999—with all of the US intelligence services on heightened alert due to the threat of millennium terror attacks—the NSA shares information from their wiretap of Al Qaeda ’ s Yemen communications hub with the CIA : Khalid Al-Mihdhar , Nawaf Alhazmi , and Salem Alhazmi will be flying to Malaysia to attend an important Al Qaeda summit the following month .\nThe CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to the Yemen communications hub , tasks agents from eight CIA offices and six friendly foreign intelligence services with tracking his travel to Malaysia .\nThe surveillance operation is successful .\nWhen Al-Mihdhar changes planes in Dubai , the CIA obtains a copy of his passport .\nInside is a vital piece of information : this known bin Laden associate , on his way to an Al Qaeda summit , has a visa to enter the United States .\nA visa that was issued at the same Jeddah consulate where , Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure visas for Osama bin Laden ’ s men during the Afghan-Soviet war .\nSeasoned intelligence officials have no trouble understanding the importance of this fact .\nReflecting on the incredible nature of this series of events years later , veteran FBI agent Jack Cloonan remarked : “ How often do you get into someone ’ s suitcase and find multiple-entry visas ?\nAnd how often do you know there ’ s going to be an organizational meeting of Al Qaeda any place in the world ?\nThe chances are slim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets .\nIt ’ s a home run in the ninth inning of the World Series .\nThis is the kind of case you hope your whole life for.\n” What happened next is so inexplicable for purveyors of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory that it is typically never discussed .\nAfter scoring this once-in-a-lifetime intelligence coup—this “ home run in the ninth inning of the World Series ” —the CIA then failed to watchlist either Al-Mihdhar or Alhazmi , allegedly lost track of them after they went on from Malaysia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel where they stayed in Bangkok ) and failed to inform FBI investigators like Ali Soufan that these known terror associates had been tracked to an Al Qaeda summit .\nMost incredibly of all , the official record shows that supervisors in the CIA ’ s Bin Laden unit repeatedly and deliberately stopped agents from sending info about Al-Mihdhar ’ s US visa to the FBI .\nOn January 5th , 2000 , while the summit was still underway in Kuala Lumpur , the CIA ’ s Riyadh station forwarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alec station at Langley .\nDoug Miller—an FBI officer assigned to the Bin Laden unit as part of an intelligence sharing program between the CIA and the FBI—read the cable and , following protocol , immediately drafted a memo asking for permission to forward the info to FBI headquarters .\nThe reply from his CIA supervisor , Michael Anne Casey , citing Alex station ’ s deputy chief , Tom Wilshere , was immediate and unequivocal : “ This is not a matter for the FBI.\n” Thus began an 18-month odyssey in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and not one of them ever officially shared it with any FBI or National Security Council official , even then-counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke .\nOn its own , this is scarcely believable .\nThe Central Intelligence Agency actively and deliberately made a decision to stop the automatic sharing of information on the most sensitive national security intelligence in their possession .\nOn September 12 , 2001 , when the CIA finally granted Ali Soufan ’ s request from nearly one year before and sent him their intelligence about the Malaysia meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , vomiting on the floor next to the toilet .\nWhen one of his colleagues asked him what had happened , he said : “ They knew , they knew.\n” But neither Soufan nor anyone else familiar with the hidden history of Al Qaeda should be surprised .\nWhen put into its context , this episode is a perfectly predictable continuation of the same pattern of intelligence agency aid that , as we have seen , defines the story of Al Qaeda .\nIt is sometimes said that in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence agencies have to get everything right all the time whereas the terrorists only have to get lucky once .\nBut the Al Qaeda “ terrorists ” —protected , shepherded and aided by the intelligence agencies as they demonstrably were—did not get lucky once .\nThey got lucky over and over and over again , time after time after time , year after year after year from their earliest beginnings through their development and growth , through their rise to international prominence , through every major terrorist attack of the 1990s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt this point , the “ incompetence ” theory of “ failures ” and “ missed opportunities ” is not only not supportable , it is a transparent falsehood .\nThere is only one conclusion possible : These “ terrorists ” were deliberately aided .\nThis is not fringe conspiracy thinking .\nEven Richard Clarke eventually came to this conclusion .\nThat the former top-ranking counterterrorism official in the United States has publicly accused the former director of the CIA and other top CIA officials of running an operation involving the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation and information about it up to and through 9/11—an incredible accusation recorded by two independent filmmakers and freely viewable on YouTube for the past decade—is apparently of so little importance that it has never been followed up on by any major media outlet .\nBut Clarke ’ s version of the story , explosive as it is—that these accused terrorists really were terrorists , that they , like Ali Mohamed , managed to triple cross the intelligence agencies that were trying to use them as double agents against Al Qaeda , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies up to and including the director of the CIA engaged in a cover up of the entire affair , indirectly allowing 9/11 to take place purely to save their own skin—demonstrably can not be the full story .\nAs we now know , these nineteen men were no devout Islamic fundamentalists driven by their devotion into striking against the infidels .\nThese alcohol-drinking , strip club-attending bumblers who , at one point , lived with an FBI informant and who left what investigators described as a deliberate trail behind them were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA .\nThey did not coordinate their plan to coincide precisely with the live fly highjacking exercises , military war games and planes-into-buildings training drills that were taking place on the day of 9/11 .\nThey did not overpower the military-trained pilots on four separate planes before a single one of them could so much as send out a hijack signal .\nThey did not know to commit those hijackings precisely in the highly-classified radar gaps that made their planes ’ movements opaque to flight traffic controllers .\nThey did not pilot those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called “ tough for any airline pilot ” despite never having sat in the cockpit of a jumbo jet before .\nThey did not cause three buildings to pulverize themselves in mid-air , falling directly through the path of most resistance at freefall gravitational acceleration with two planes .\nThey did not decide to fly around the Pentagon to miss the Defense Secretary ’ s office and instead hit the section of the building where bookkeepers and budget analysts were working on the problem of the $ 2.3 trillion that Donald Rumsfeld had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accounted for in the Defence Department ’ s budget .\nThey did not commit the informed trading that three separate academic studies have proven did take place in the run up to 9/11 .\nThey did not engage in the decades-long cover up of these facts in the wake of that attack .\nAnd they did not launch the war of terror that sometimes saw the US and its allies using Al Qaeda as a convenient excuse for aggression in foreign countries and other times saw them actively collaborating with Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRichard Clarke ’ s story is itself a cover up .\nThe spectacular , catalyzing terror attack of 9/11 was not allowed to happen .\nIt was made to happen .\nBut why ?\nWho , other than the devout Muslim suicide warriors posited by the official 9/11 conspiracy theorists , would do such a thing ?\nAnd for what purpose ?\nTo answer these questions , we need to return to Operation Susannah and the false flag terror ruse that has been employed by the British , the Israelis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall see , just eight years after Operation Susannah failed in Egypt , the highest-ranking officials in the US military drafted plans to stage terror attacks , blow up airliners and even kill Americans in order to blame their political enemies .\nAnd in the lead up to 9/11 a cadre of political operatives brought those plans into the 21st century , paving the way for a new Pearl Harbor that would begin a worldwide war of terror and a clash of civilizations .\nVisit James Corbett at CorbettReport.com .\nSubscribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patron !\nOr support us at SubscribeStar Donate cryptocurrency HERE Subscribe to

to the cinema quarter , each nervously clutching a device in their pocket . eyeing the fire trucks parked at the intersections , philip leans over to victor and whispers : “ they ’ re expecting us. ” they reach the steps of the rio cinema just as the audience from the afternoon showing begin pouring out of the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people and into the foyer and immediately see a man in the usual garb of an egyptian plainclothes detective waiting for them . philip turns to run away but instantly a wave of heat begins to sear his thigh . he tries to tell victor to run , but no words come out . instead , a white hot flame leaps from his trousers . he squeezes his thigh with all his strength in a vain attempt to stop the flame before the bomb can ignite—but it ’ s too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs burnt black from the bomb . victor is nowhere to be seen . soon , a police sergeant arrives , along with the plainclothes detective . someone in the crowd shouts , “ take care ! he may have another bomb ! ” but the sergeant moves in all the same . “ don ’ t worry . we were waiting for them. ” the police had been expecting them . victor and philip were egyptian jews , members of a sleeper cell established by israeli military intelligence in 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the military coup in egypt in 1952 led to the rise of gamel abdel nasser , who was not only hostile to israel , but who , as a perceived anti-communist , was securing military and financial aid from the americans and even the british . with britain already staging talks to withdraw from their suez military base , israel decided to act . in 1954 , they activated their military intelligence sleeper cell in the country for an audacious mission . codenamed operation susannah , their plan was to stage an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alexandria . the first bombing—an explosion at the alexandria central post office on july 2nd—had gone off without a hitch . the second , a simultaneous attack on the american libraries in cairo and alexandria , was similarly successful . it was their third attack—an ambitious attempt to bomb two cinemas in cairo , two in alexandria and the cairo railway station—that failed , derailing the operation . ten members of the cell were rounded up . of the ten , two committed suicide in the course of their interrogations by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and six were sentenced to prison , eventually making their way to israel after their release . after decades of internal israeli investigations , finger pointing , political scandal and high-profile resignations , the full truth of operation susannah remains shrouded in official secrecy . the israeli government did not even formally acknowledge the incident until 2005 , a full half century after the affair , when nine of the agents were officially commended for their service . but the reasoning behind the operation was revealed during one of the commissions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . according to one officer who was given oral instructions directly from israel ’ s military intelligence chief , binyamin gibli : in short , the israelis had attempted a false flag operation , hoping to blame their own spectacular acts of violence on the muslim brotherhood or the communists in order to destabilize nasser ’ s government , undermine western confidence in its egyptian ally , and persuade the british military to remain at their suez base . the operation was a failure in every sense . the cell was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not destabilize the nasser government , nor did they influence the relationship between egypt and the west . and the british did leave their base in 1956 , after an abortive israeli/british/french invasion of the region was brought to an end by the us and the soviets . but it did implant an idea in the minds of the western military planners : that acts of terrorism could be staged and blamed on muslim scapegoats to further their own political goals . as we shall see , it was not long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own operational plans making use of this tactic . . . plans that would culminate in the most spectacular terrorist attack the world had yet seen . tuesday , september 11 , 2001 , dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern united states . in a matter of moments , however , the quiet of that tuesday morning transformed into the turbulence of 9/11 and the world seemed to turn upside-down . as the events of that day played out like a hollywood movie on tv screens around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from clear . who was behind this attack ? why were they attacking ? what did the perpetrators hope to gain from it ? and yet it was there , in the initial hours of those chaotic events—years before the congressional inquiries and presidential commissions presumed to answer those questions—that all of the essential pieces of the official story of 9/11 were laid out on the tv screens of the american public . remarkably , these initial , off-the-cuff speculations turned out to be—according to the various inquiries and investigations that followed—accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin laden , the mastermind of the al qaeda terrorist organization , had planned and directed this attack . the twin towers had collapsed due to structural failure because the fire was just too intense . these assertions , drilled into the minds of a susceptible audience still reeling in shock from the horror of the events they had just witnessed , became the core tenets of what would become enshrined in the final report of the 9/11 commission as the “ official story ” of 9/11 . in this official story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-soviet warrior on the road to peace , ” was now an international terror kingpin . radicalized by the arrival of us military forces in the arabian peninsula in the gulf war , he issued a fatwa against the united states and began a series of strikes on us targets ; first bombing the us embassies in tanzania and kenya in 1998 , and then bombing the uss cole while it was harbored in aden in october of 2000 . according to this version of events , the 9/11 plot was hatched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated ” pakistani militant who presented the “ planes operation “ —as the 9/11 commission asserts it was originally known—to osama bin laden and his chief of operations , mohammed atef , in 1996 . it was bin laden , we are told , who greenlighted the operation “ sometime in late 1998 or early 1999. ” the three of them developed a list of buildings to be targeted—the white house , the u.s. capitol , the pentagon , and the world trade center—and bin laden himself hand-picked the men he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operatives into place over the course of the next two years , this crack terror squad—devoted muslim radicals willing to die for their beliefs—succeeded through a combination of skill and the colossal failure of the american intelligence complex , hindered by bureaucracy and hampered by a lack of political will to recognize the growing threat of islamic terror . no individual was to blame for this “ failure , ” the official story of 9/11 concludes , but the remedy to the problems presented by the 9/11 attack was obvious : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear down the walls between foreign intelligence and domestic policing , implement warrantless surveillance and other legally dubious means of disrupting potential terror threats on the home front , and launch a war on terror abroad to bring the battle to the terrorists . but this narrative , now enshrined as the official history of 9/11—that the 9/11 plot was hatched by khalid sheikh mohammed in 1996 , that it was directed by terrorist mastermind osama bin laden and that it was executed by al qaeda so flawlessly that the intelligence agencies could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone prevented it— —is now contested in every respect , even by defenders of that official history . as even mainstream authors like jason burke were forced to admit , the popular conception of al qaeda—that of a top-down organization with a single leader overseeing its operations—was a convenient fiction , created by the fbi so they could prosecute bin laden in absentia for the 1998 bombings of two us embassies in east africa . in order to prosecute bin laden , they had to show that al qaeda “ coordinates the activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin laden , as the leader of the group , bears the responsibility for any actions attributed to the organization . even the 9/11 commission ’ s final report had to admit that al qaeda was less of a mafia-like organization with a capo served by his faithful lieutenants and more of a funding organization for “ terrorist entrepreneurs. ” “ al qaeda ’ s worldwide terrorist operations , ” the report conceded , “ relied heavily on the ideas and work of enterprising and strong-willed field commanders who enjoyed considerable autonomy. ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this exploration , origin story , these “ terrorist entrepreneurs ” included among their ranks renowned international islamic radicals—like “ the blind sheikh , ” omar abdel-rahman—and lesser-known but incredibly prolific terror cell leaders—like ali mohamed—whose remarkable abilities to evade state department watch lists and foment and direct spectacular terror attacks directly under the nose of the intelligence agencies defies explanation . . . unless one assumes , as their closest associates did , that they were working under the purview of those intelligence agencies . in order to better understand this aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to 1990 , the year that the specter of islamic terror appeared on the shores of the united states . abdullah azzam—osama bin laden ’ s mentor and co-founder with bin laden of the maktab al-khidamat ( mak ) , or the “ office of services , ” which provided funding , training and an international support network to the “ afghan arabs ” during the soviet-afghan war—is dead , killed in a car bombing in peshawar , pakistan . it is never determined who committed the assassination , but azzam ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of the jihad movement . azzam had favoured continuing the fight in afghanistan , pressing for the formation of an islamic regime in kabul . bin laden had other ideas ; and now , as the undisputed leader of the old mak network , he is free to pursue those ideas under the “ al qaeda ” banner . but “ al qaeda , ” at this point , barely even exists as a propaganda construct . despite grandiose visions of creating “ a unified global jihad movement , ” the withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the war leaves the group ’ s future in doubt . bin laden returns to saudi arabia , looking for ways to leverage his family ’ s wealth and power to make a name for himself in the muslim world . meanwhile , in new york , the era of “ islamic terror ” in the united states is about to begin . meir kahane—an orthodox jewish rabbi and a convicted terrorist whose anti-arab views were considered so extreme he was banned from the israeli knesset—has just finished delivering a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new york marriott east side hotel . leaving the podium , kahane has begun mingling with the crowd . suddenly one man , sayyid nosair , draws a .357 magnum and fires , hitting kahane twice , once in the neck . nosair flees , shooting one of kahane ’ s supporters in the leg in his rush out the door . his accomplice , mahmud abouhalima , is supposed to be waiting at the front door in a taxi to drive him away , but the doorman had waved abouhalima away moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong cab by mistake . when he realizes his error , he brandishes the .357 , ordering the cabbie to start driving . instead , the driver scrambles out of the taxi and runs away . nosair is forced to flee on foot , racing down lexington avenue with his gun still in hand . carlos acosta , a us postal inspector , tries to stop him , drawing his weapon , but it ’ s too late ; nosair fires first , hitting acosta in the shoulder . undeterred , acosta drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots back , hitting nosair in the neck . both nosair and kahane are rushed to bellevue hospital ’ s trauma unit . nosair survives his emergency operation . kahane does not . the dramatic events of that november night would culminate in an even more surprising verdict 13 months later . not only was nosair treated as a “ lone gunman ” acting of his own accord , but he was not even convicted of kahane ’ s murder . despite such a brazen assassination—perpetrated in a crowded room and followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , convicted instead on four lesser counts , including gun possession , assault and coercion . he was sentenced to just 22 years . so , what went wrong ? the jurors contend that they had “ reasonable doubt ” of nosair ’ s guilt because “ the prosecution did not offer a witness during the five-week trial who saw the defendant fire the fatal shots ” and—since kahane ’ s family had opposed an autopsy—the fatal bullet could not be matched to nosair ’ s weapon . but , in reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . as even the congressional joint inquiry into the 9/11 attacks conceded in a staff statement a decade after the trial : the typically bureaucratic wording of the statement obscures the reality : the nypd and the district attorney ’ s office didn ’ t just passively resist the attempts to “ label ” the assassination a “ conspiracy ” ; they deliberately covered up vitally important information that would have unwound that conspiracy and undermined the next decade of spectacular al qaeda terrorism . immediately after his arrest , forty-seven boxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in new jersey . among those materials were top secret training manuals from fort bragg and secret communiqués from the us joint chiefs of staff . lest there be any doubt where the materials came from , they even discovered a video of ali mohammed ’ s lectures at the kennedy special warfare center at fort bragg . but those weren ’ t the only pieces of evidence that connected the kahane assassination conspiracy—now commonly portrayed as the first act of islamic terrorism on us soil—to ali mohammed , the remarkable cia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informant who , we are told , was “ al qaeda ’ s ” strangely untouchable “ triple agent ” in the heart of the american intelligence establishment . el sayyid nosair himself—the 34-year old egyptian-born janitor with a penchant for prozac who quite literally got away with murder—was , as it turns out , not unknown to the authorities . in fact , he had been known to the fbi since at least the previous summer . that ’ s when , as it was later admitted , nosair and a ragtag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a convoy of vehicles with semi-aututomatic weapons and copious amounts of ammo and heading to the calverton shooting range on long island . for four consecutive sundays in july of 1989 , the fbi ’ s elite special o perations group—apparently tipped off that “ plo terrorists were threatening to blow up casinos in atlantic city ” —followed nosair ’ s convoy to the shooting range , snapping dozens of photographs of the group engaging in target practice with handguns , rifles and even an ak-47 . the group had set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qaeda ’ s new york office , which , as we have seen , not only operated in full view of the intelligence community but “ doubled as a recruiting post for the cia seeking to steer fresh troops to the mujahideen ” in afghanistan . among those in attendance at the fbi-surveilled target practice sessions : • nosair himself , brandishing the chrome-plated .357 that he would later use to slay kahane ; • clement rodney hampton-el , an american-born black muslim medical technician known as “ dr . rashid ” who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; • mahmud abouhalima , known as “ the red ” for his curly red hair , covered during the sessions by an nra cap ; • nidal ayyad , a kuwaiti who had taken classes to become a us citizen ; • and mohammed salameh , a palestinian who grew up in jordan and studied under abdullah azzam . not present at those sessions in july , however , was the group ’ s trainer , ali mohammed , the remarkable al qaeda “ triple agent ” who had been taking weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the us army ’ s special forces training center at fort bragg to instruct the al kifah cell in the techniques of guerrilla warfare , including bomb making and weapons handling . nosair and his fellow al kifah plotters had been under surveillance by the fbi . mohammed , their handler came straight from fort bragg , providing them with top secret government documents and personally overseeing their training . but , incredibly , none of these points were raised at nosair ’ s trial for the murder of kahane . fbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bigger plot were ordered to stand down . and , according to the official history , the boxes of arabic documents seized from nosair ’ s house were not translated until years later . nosair ’ s not guilty verdict was cheered by his supporters , and the same cadre of ali mohammed-trained radicals who had been surveilled at the shooting range by the fbi moved on to plot their next spectacular terror attack : the bombing of the world trade center . and , as would be revealed in dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , too , had an fbi informant at its heart . when emad salem—a former lieutenant colonel in the egyptian army who arrived in the united states in 1988—began working as an fbi asset , he was not originally assigned to infiltrate islamic terror groups . no , in 1988 the cold war was still on and the fbi tasked salem with penetrating kgb and russian mafia rings operating in new york city . but by 1991 , things had changed . with the cold war over , the bureau ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handler , nancy floyd , who appreciated his work , thought the egyptian informant ’ s background might make him useful to the fbi ’ s joint terrorism task force . salem ’ s new handlers in the bureau ’ s counterterror division , louie napoli and john anticev , put him to work infiltrating the groups raising funds for international islamic terror on us soil . his first priority : insinuating himself into the ring around the blind sheikh , omar abel rahman , including el sayyid nosair , then on trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calverton shooting range associates . salem was remarkably successful in his assignment . haunting the trial of nosair , he soon befriended nosair ’ s cousin , ibrahim el-gabrowny . el-gabrowny immediately took to the affable egyptian , introducing salem to nosair in jail and describing him as “ a new member of the family. ” in a mere matter of weeks , salem was caught on camera as one of rahman ’ s bodyguards , even personally driving the blind sheikh to detroit to deliver fundraising speeches . soon thereafter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at his brooklyn apartment . there , after turning up the television in the dining room , explaining that he feared the apartment was bugged , el-gabrowny sought to recruit salem for a special mission . at this early stage , the plot was less of a precise plan and more of a vague idea , devoid of details . even the target of the proposed attack was undecided , with salem being told that the group intended to set off bombs at twelve “ jewish locations , ” including temples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhattan . without knowing it and with hardly any effort , salem had been recruited into an operation that would eventually result in the 1993 world trade center bombing . salem worked the plot as best he could , meeting more of the calverton shooting range associates and gathering information from the cell members to pass along to the bureau . as the preparations for the bombing began to take shape , salem ’ s role in the fbi sting operation seemed clear : he would lead the cell along , swapping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bombs were placed . then , when the cell was ready to strike , the fbi would swoop in and round up the plotters . but that is not what happened . salem ’ s remarkable success in infiltrating an active plot to stage terror attacks in new york—something that most fbi assets fail to accomplish in the course of their career— is , in retrospect , stunning . but not as stunning as the fbi ’ s response to this incredible turn of events . as author and journalist peter lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel involved in the story , explained in his book , triple cross : but in june 1992 , carson dunbar—a rising young star in the fbi ’ s new york office—was appointed to head the counterterror division . dunbar and his deputy , john crouthamel , didn ’ t trust salem . soon they were trying to get him to submit to additional polygraphs and , eventually , they broke their deal with salem and demanded he wear a wire . salem refused and withdrew from the operation , shutting the fbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salem out of the picture , the ali mohammed-trained , blind sheikh-supported , al kifah-connected cell continued on with their plot . but , with internal disputes disrupting their plans , they had to find someone else to actually build the bomb . they found that person in ramzi yousef . to this day , despite having been caught , tried and convicted for the world trade center bombing , little is known about ramzi yousef ’ s origins , or even his identity . the 9/11 commission—relying on the torture testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely as a “ sunni extremist ” whose real name was abdul basit . but this supposedly devout muslim fundamentalist is reported to have hung out at karaoke bars and dated b-girls during his trips to the philippines while his wife and daughters waited for him in baluchistan . even his birthplace remains a mystery . what is known is that yousef learned bomb-making in osama bin laden ’ s training camps in afghanistan in the early 1990s , perhaps from ali mohammed himself ; that in 1995 newsday reported that the fbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cia had any relationship with yousef ; ” and that in 1999 swiss journalist richard labeviere reported that a “ classified fbi file indicates that he was recruited by the local branch of the cia. ” and , like so many of the other key operatives in the al qaeda story , yousef was able to avoid regular screening procedures , waltz across borders with forged travel documents and enter the united states without a visa . on august 31 , 1992 , yousef and ahmad ajaj—a fellow mujahideen who yousef had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afghanistan—flew from pakistan to the us despite lacking the proper travel documents to do so , a miraculous feat that the fbi has alleged was enabled by “ direct assistance from senior pakistani intelligence officials. ” upon their arrival at john f. kennedy international airport in new york on september 1st , both men were immediately detained by immigration officials . ajaj , acting “ loud and belligerent , ” was caught with a crudely forged swedish passport and taken to a back office for questioning . “ the u.s. government was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment he stepped foot on u.s. soil , ” the los angeles times later reported , noting that his suitcases were “ stuffed with fake passports , fake ids and a cheat sheet on how to lie to u.s. immigration inspectors. ” but that wasn ’ t all ; among his possessions , inspectors also found two handwritten notebooks filled with bomb recipes , six bomb-making guides that included pages from fort bragg military manuals , and four how-to videotapes concerning weaponry and surveillance training . ajaj was charged with passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . yousef , meanwhile , tried a different approach . dressed in “ traditional peasant garb ” and carrying an iraqi passport without a us visa , yousef strode confidently up to the immigration inspector and declared himself to be a refugee seeking asylum from the oppressive iraqi government , politely asking to be admitted into america . after being questioned and fingerprinted , one alert immigration official noted his links to ajaj and sought to detain him , but “ there was not enough room in the ins lockup , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he show up at an asylum hearing later . yousef then left the airport , took a cab to new york ’ s east village and immediately met with mahmud abouhalima , “ the red , ” who had trained with ali mohammed and who had served as the getaway driver for nosair before being waved away by the hotel doorman . yousef set about professionalizing the ragtag band of misfits , transforming their vague “ jewish locations ” plot into an altogether more ambitious plan : to plant a bomb in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towers of the world trade center , collapsing it into the other tower and killing tens of thousands in the process . he got to work immediately , organizing the cell , renting a storage locker across the hudson river in jersey city and beginning the five month task of constructing the bomb . without salem , the fbi ostensibly no longer had an asset in the cell to watch as the plot took shape . but , if there had been a serious investigation underway , unraveling the cell and discovering their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ajaj , who had been caught with a raft of terrorist training materials and bomb-making guides , remained in contact without yousef the whole time , speaking to him frequently via the prison phone . but , although those calls were taped , no one from the fbi or any other agency monitored or even attempted to translate those phone calls until after the world trade center explosion the following february , and no one traced the pair ’ s flights back to discover that they had both boarded in pakistan without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for the first leg of their journey to new york . salem even tried one last time to warn the fbi about the cell . meeting his old handler , nancy floyd , at a subway sandwich shop near the fbi ’ s new york office in october of 1992 to collect his final $ 500 cash payment , he informed her that he had heard that the group was planning a new attack and begged her to put surveillance on abouhalima and salameh . but it was no use . carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and all she could do was pass along the suggestion . salem ’ s warning was ignored and no one followed up on the lead . the fbi had followed the al kifah plotters to the shooting range , investigated their role in the kahane murder , had an informant in their midst reporting on their plans for a spectacular terror attack and now another high-level terror operative had been allowed to enter the country and proceed with his activities unmolested , just as ali mohammed and the blind sheikh before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon on february 26 , 1993 , ramzi yousef and eyad ismoil , a jordanian associate , drove a yellow ryder van into the underground parking garage of the world trade center , parking on the b-2 level . yousef ignited the 20-foot fuse and fled . twelve minutes later , the bomb went off . the bomb—cutting through the parking garage with an explosive force of 150,000 pounds per square inch— might have lacked the explosive force to fulfill yousef ’ s goal of toppling the towers , but it did wreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand were injured and 50,000 were forced to evacuate the building in the chaotic aftermath of the explosion . learning of the bombing , bruce hoffman , a terrorism expert working for the rand corporation , remarked : “ we may be talking about the opening salvo of a new conflict for a new world order. ” as the investigation into the bombing began , a letter arrived in the offices of various new york newspapers claiming responsibility for the attack . the letter , sent under the name “ liberation army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : end us aid to israel , end diplomatic relations with israel and stop interfering with the internal affairs of middle eastern nations . if these demands were not met , the letter promised that 150 suicide soldiers would be ready to commit more attacks , including launching strikes on “ potential nuclear targets. ” if there was any doubt about who was behind the explosion , those doubts were quickly dispelled . just two days into the investigation , in one of the fbi ’ s first descents into the pitch-black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast , an explosives enforcement officer from the atf found the proverbial “ needle in the haystack “ : a part from the ryder van itself bearing a vehicle identification number . the van rental was traced back to mohammed salameh , one of ali mohammed ’ s trainees from the al kifah center . absurdly , salameh was apprehended on march 4 , one week after the bombing , when he returned to the ryder rental office in jersey city to reclaim the deposit on the van . salameh ’ s arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of three others in the al kifah cell : nidal ayyad , mahmud abouhalima and ahmad ajaj . it also led investigators to the apartment of ramzi yousef . but it was too late . ramzi yousef had boarded a flight to karachi the night of the bombing and then vanished , flying from country to country with impunity , plotting assassinations and bombings in pakistan , thailand , the philippines and iran , and concocting an elaborate plot called “ bojinka ” to blow up a number of airliners in mid-flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 . but it was not just yousef himself—the mysteriously protected terror mastermind who had entered the us without a visa—who vanished . when pakistani federal investigators later went to check their immigration records , they discovered that all of the documents pertaining to yousef ’ s journey to the united states in 1992 , including his embarkation card , had “ mysteriously disappeared. ” in the wake of the bombing , the fbi—now facing enormous public pressure to round up those involved and bust the terror cell that they had infiltrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emad salem . once again , salem was able to quickly penetrate the blind sheikh ’ s cell and to begin working with them on a new scheme , the so-called “ landmarks ” plot to bomb key targets around new york city , including the un headquarters , the lincoln tunnel and the george washington bridge . this time , the fbi arrested the plotters before they could stage their attack . but at the trial two years later , salem had a surprise for the prosecution . he had secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fbi handlers , conversations that revealed for the first time the fbi ’ s real role in the world trade center bombing . predictably , in the wake of the blast , the debate began to center on the government ’ s “ mismanagement ” of the case . the blind sheikh ’ s entry to the us had been a “ mistake. ” the nypd ’ s refusal to investigate nosair ’ s accomplices in the killing of kahane had just been a politically expedient omission . the fbi having pulled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it developed into the world trade center bombing was simply “ incompetence. ” the presence of a cia-linked , fort bragg-stationed green beret in the midst of this radical terror cell was just an example of “ blowback. ” and ramzi yousef ’ s miraculous ability to enter and leave countries at will without the proper documentation was just the result of bureaucratic bungling and overworked immigration officials . the admissions of “ error ” and professions of “ blowback ” verged on admissions of guilt . even the cia—in an internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al kifah center ’ s operations—concluded that the agency itself was “ partly culpable ” for the world trade center bombing . but the “ incompetence ” narrative soon arrived at its inevitable conclusion : the very agencies that had so signally “ bungled ” every step along this path were now to be given more money and bestowed more authority to conduct their “ counterterror ” operations . others proposed a less charitable reading of these events . ron kuby , the lawyer who , along with william kunstler , acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their accomplices—did not mince words in assigning blame for the world trade center bombing plot : emad salem himself summarized the story of the world trade center bombing in a phone call with his fbi handler , john anticev , that was later released to the public . if this pattern of “ missed opportunities ” and “ miraculous ” cross-border movements really had been the result of mere “ incompetence ” or “ inattentiveness , ” then the resources and attention that were thrown at the problem of international terrorism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing would have improved the intelligence agencies ’ record against their erstwhile foes . but , remarkably , the scarcely believable trend of the early 1990s—that of intelligence agencies consistently “ missing ” the terrorists operating directly under their nose , border agents allowing known terrorists to pass from country to country unmolested and law enforcement officials letting these al qaeda-linked operatives off the hook—did not just continue into the late 1990s , the trend actually accelerated . and , as al qaeda went from a loose-knit group of a few dozen amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the premiere international terrorist organization at the end of the decade , the number of “ mistakes ” and “ missed opportunities ” multiplied from the merely unbelievable to the downright impossible . when mahmud abouhalima was arrested for his part in the world trade center plot in 1993 , he attempted to bargain with federal prosecutors . abouhalima revealed the name of wadih el-hage—a lebanese-born naturalized american citizen living in texas who the al kifah cell had turned to for help in purchasing weapons—and recounted his experiences in afghanistan with mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would later claim to have provided the rifles and rocket launchers that killed 18 u.s. soldiers and wounded 73 in mogadishu in october of 1993 . abouhalima then offered more information about the world trade center plot and his associates in exchange for a lighter sentence . prosecutors turned down the deal and failed to follow up on either el-hage or odeh . ali mohamed , meanwhile , continued in his remarkably successful mission to infiltrate the intelligence arms of the us government . after having worked for the cia and served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his next target was the fbi . following his honourable discharge from the army , mohamed returned to his wife in california and applied to be a translator for the bureau . he was turned down for the position ; instead , he was asked to work as an fbi informant in a local document forgery ring . in 1992 , the bureau—evidently impressed with mohamed ’ s work— “ opened ” him as a foreign counter intelligence agent and tasked him with gaining intelligence on a san jose mosque . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routine steps like administering a polygraph were never taken . as a retired special agent who worked in the fbi ’ s new york office later told journalist peter lance : “ one of the most unbelievable aspects of the ali mohamed story is that the bureau could be dealing with this guy and they didn ’ t put him on the box . the first thing you do with any kind of asset or informant is you polygraph him and if the relationship continues , you make him submit to continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic principle of running informants. ” still , despite repeatedly traveling back and forth to and from the middle east throughout the period , mohamed remained untouchable by law enforcement and border security . in 1992 , he was detained in rome when he was discovered with a coca-cola can containing a secret storage compartment . mohamed convinced the airport security that he was a security agent for the summer olympics in barcelona and was released with a warning that if anything happened on the flight , he would be blamed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the us on forged documents for a fundraising tour , mohamed traveled to vancouver , canada to help an associate of zawahiri , essam marzouk , enter the country . marzouk , caught with forged saudi passports by canadian customs officials , was detained by the royal canadian mounted police . when mohamed arrived inquiring about his friend , he was detained by the rcmp as well . after hours of interrogation , he told them he was an fbi asset , giving them the phone number of his handler , john @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough . the rcmp let mohamed go . mohamed ’ s travels during this busy period included a trip to afghanistan in the summer of 1991 to help osama bin laden and his fledgling al qaeda organization relocate to sudan . osama ’ s move to sudan came at a time when , we are told , the wealthy saudi was looking to cement his reputation as a holy warrior . the official story of al qaeda holds that during this period , bin laden returned briefly to saudi arabia but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite us soldiers onto saudi soil for the gulf war , left the country for good . searching for a place to move his operations , his gaze turned across the red sea to sudan , where , as luck would have it , hardline islamic extremist hassan al-turabi had come to power in a military coup just as the war was ending in afghanistan . heading the national islamic front party , which sought to impose sharia law in the country , al-turabi traveled to london for a meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention to allow sudan to act as a base for islamist terror groups . by the summer of 1991 , osama bin laden had answered that call , moving his fighters and equipment from the outskirts of afghanistan to his new base in sudan with the help of fbi asset ali mohamed . turabi was not the only one traveling to london to foster his terror plans , however . in between bin laden ’ s work establishing himself as a businessman in sudan—using $ 12 million granted him by the saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commercial enterprises in the country , from a construction company to an investment firm to a trucking business to a tannery , a bakery , a furniture-making business and even a commercial farm employing four thousand labourers—the budding terror mastermind was , according to numerous sources , shuttling back and forth between khartoum , karachi and london . osama bin laden ’ s visits to the uk in the early 1990s include an alleged stay at the london estate of saudi billionaire khalid bin mahfouz , a meeting in manchester with representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later accused of being infiltrated by government moles and used to launch a series of false flag attacks in france , a period of several months in 1994 when he actually lived in the uk , allegedly buying a house in wembley through an intermediate , and , even more explosively , a 1996 trip to his london press office which was—according to swiss journalist richard labeviere , citing “ several arab diplomatic sources ” — ” clearly under the protection of the british authorities. ” although the official story holds that bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blip on the us intelligence community ’ s radar , this is contradicted by numerous lines of evidence . ali mohamed , for instance , had “ volunteered the earliest insider description of al qaeda that is publicly known ” to the fbi in 1993 , telling them that bin laden was “ building an army ” to overthrow the saudi government and admitting that he had personally trained terrorists at the camps in afghanistan and sudan . but the fbi , according to the wall street journal , was “ flummoxed ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act on it . this “ news ” about al qaeda ’ s activities would not have been news to the us government ’ s main intelligence agencies , however . it was later revealed that , despite claims that the us government was only dimly aware of bin laden at this point , he was in fact already under extensive electronic surveillance . having obtained his voiceprint from recordings of his anti-saddam speeches in saudi arabia , the nsa and cia were already using signals intelligence to identify and monitor bin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell phone traffic . in another key contradiction that is never addressed by the purveyors of the official al qaeda story , it was during this period that osama bin laden—making trips to the uk under the alleged protection of british authorities and while admittedly under surveillance by american intelligence—began the streak of increasingly brazen terror attacks that , we are told , would end up in 9/11 . in 1992 , al qaeda mounted their first terror operation against an american target . in december of that year , bombs went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was believed , american servicemen were being quartered on their way to somalia for operation restore hope . the attack killed an australian tourist and a yemeni hotel worker , but no americans ; the troops had been staying at a different hotel . osama only claimed responsibility for the bombing six years later . in 1993 , eighteen american soldiers were killed and 73 wounded in mogadishu during an intense two-day firefight that resulted in the downing of two black hawk helicopters by rocket-propelled grenades . it wasn ’ t until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2004 , however , that the commission—citing “ new information ” received by “ the intelligence community ” in “ 1996—1997″—told the public that al qaeda had had a role in the incident . the burnishing of bin laden ’ s terrorist credentials by the us government continued in 1996 . in january of that year , the cia officially opened “ alec station , ” a so-called virtual station dedicated solely to tracking osama bin laden and his associates . headed at first by michael scheuer—an analyst at the cia ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special interest in the saudi exile—and named after scheuer ’ s son , alec station soon became the hub for a mostly-female group of analysts who dubbed themselves “ the manson family ” because “ they had acquired a reputation for crazed alarmism about the rising al-qaeda threat. ” 1996 was also the year that the us government began putting diplomatic pressure on sudan to hand over their files on bin laden and his al qaeda operatives . the secret negotiations between the two countries culminated with elfatih erwa , sudan ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying from khartoum to washington . there , erwa made a stunning offer : not to turn over the sudanese government ’ s records on bin laden , but to turn over bin laden himself . washington rejected the offer because , the village voice later reported , “ the fbi did not believe it had sufficient evidence to try bin laden in a us court. ” instead , they demanded that sudan expel the supposed arch-terrorist to “ any other country except somalia. ” sudan complied , protesting that osama would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government for washington to negotiate with . “ we told him sudan is no longer safe for him and creates problems for us and asked him to leave , ” erwa told the village voice . in june of 1996 , a truck bomb exploded outside of the khobar towers in dhahran , saudi arabia . the facility—located in the heart of the saudi oil industry ’ s administrative area , where the us had built its first air base and where standard oil first struck oil in the country , establishing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allied forces involved in enforcing the iraqi no-fly zones . the massive blast left an 85-foot crater , killing 19 and injuring hundreds . at the time , the us blamed tehran for the bombing , with clinton ’ s defense secretary william perry later admitting that there was a contingency plan in place to attack iran if the link had been proven . but by 2007 , perry had changed his assessment : one thing is for certain : in 1998 , the $ 150 million contract to rebuild the khobar towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all of these incidents helped to raise bin ladens profile in the intelligence community , but it was a series of events in 1998 that introduced the broader public to osama bin laden . in february of that year , bin laden—following up on a declaration of war against america that he had made to cnn ’ s tv cameras in an interview with peter bergen the previous year—issued his fatwa calling on muslims to kill americans : in may of that year , john miller—then reporting for abc news , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief spokesman—traveled to afghanistan for a dramatic nightline report on “ the most dangerous man you ’ ve never heard of ” that would air on abc the following month : and , in august of 1998 , the name of osama bin laden , terror mastermind , and his shadowy terror group , al qaeda , finally exploded into the public consciousness . on the morning of august 7 , 1998 , two saudis in kenya—mohammed al- ‘ owhali and “ jihad ali ” azzam , both of whom had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ osama bin laden earlier that year—loaded some boxes into their toyota cargo truck and headed off to the american embassy in downtown nairobi . the boxes contained two thousand pounds of tnt , aluminum nitrate and aluminum powder . at the same time , hamden khalif allah awad—an egyptian known as “ ahmed the german ” for his fair hair—loaded a similar bomb into a gasoline truck in tanzania and set off for the american embassy in dar es salaam . the saudis arrived at the nairobi embassy at 10:30 am . ‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it approached the gates , demanding that the security guard raise the drop bar protecting the entrance . the guard refused . ‘ owhali threw a stun grenade into the courtyard and ran and then the bomb went off . the blast ripped the face off of the embassy building , collapsing a nearby secretarial college and lighting the tar-covered street and a nearby bus on fire . 213 were dead and 4,500 injured . nine minutes later , ahmed the german parked the gasoline truck in the parking lot of the american @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bomb . he had parked next to a water tanker truck , which ended up absorbing much of the blast , but the building was still badly damaged . 11 were dead and 85 injured . the message was clear and was dutifully broadcast by media around the world : a “ new ” terror group had conducted a sophisticated , coordinated attack against multiple us targets overseas and its leader was waging holy war against americans . al qaeda had arrived . but , like so many events in the al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bore the fingerprints of american intelligence on each stage of its development and execution . the attacks , prosecutors later discovered , were being planned as far back as 1993 , when osama bin laden sent his fbi/cia/green beret triple agent extraordinaire , ali mohamed “ to survey potential u.s. , british , french and israeli targets in nairobi. ” according to mohamed ’ s own testimony : joining mohamed on the scouting mission was anas al liby , a member of a libyan al qaeda cell known as al-muqatila . described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qaeda ’ s hierarchy , ” not only was al-liby personally trained by mohamed at the al qaeda camp in afghanistan , he was also a protected british intelligence asset . al-liby applied for asylum in britain in 1995 , claiming to be a political enemy of the libyan government . but , as the guardian later reported : even more incredibly , not only did the british government grant that asylum , they then recruited al-liby for a failed mi6 operation to assassinate libyan leader muammar gaddafi in 1996 , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country even after the embassy bombing before ultimately letting him escape . according to fbi investigator ali soufan , the manchester raid didn ’ t just nab a “ manual for jihad ; ” it caught al-liby himself . as soufan recounts in his book , the black banners , the british police let al-liby go when he denied being a terrorist . he evaded the team that was sent to follow him and fled the country , eventually ending up on the us government ’ s most wanted list with a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another important figure in the bombing who was well-known to american intelligence was wadih el-hage , the naturalized american citizen who had assisted the al kifah plotters and who mahmud abouhalima had identified to prosecutors after his arrest for the world trade center bombing . as was later revealed , us intelligence had el-hage under surveillance during the entire period that the embassy bombing plot was being hatched , but once again merely watched as the attack unfolded . as the los angeles times detailed : author simon reeve revealed even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot in his 1999 book , the new jackals . “ the cia also had informants working within the east africa cell , ” he reported , citing an interview with a cia official , “ but they apparently failed to warn of bin laden ’ s plans. ” even if the cia ’ s sources within the plot had somehow “ failed ” to warn them of the attack , the fact that multiple members of the cell under their surveillance—including abdullah ahmed abdulah , ahmed khalfan ghailani , usama al-kini , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled kenya for pakistan the night before the bombing would have instantly raised alarm bells if the agencies ’ intention had been to prevent an attack . instead , the plotters conspired with cia informants in their midst and the attacks went ahead under the watchful eye of cia , nsa and fbi surveillance . however they transpired , the bombings succeeded in introducing osama bin laden and al qaeda to the world stage . despite the years of intelligence agency surveillance and even the creation of a virtual cia station dedicated solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bin laden and his network , it wasn ’ t until after the embassy bombings that the world at large began to hear the name of osama bin laden . on august 20th—three weeks after the bombing and just three days after being publicly interrogated about the monica lewinsky affair—president clinton ordered a missile strike on alleged al qaeda targets in afghanistan and sudan , boldly proclaiming that actions against bin laden and international terror had become a new mission for the us military . the strike , however—a barrage of 66 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s camp in khost , afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant thought to be manufacturing chemical weapons in khartoum—was a spectacular failure on almost every level . neither bin laden nor zawahiri were killed in the attacks and the “ chemical weapons ” plant in khartoum had nothing to do with either bin laden or chemical weapons , but was in fact manufacturing much-needed medicines for the region . the plant ’ s destruction—in the estimation of werner daum , then germany ’ s ambassador to sudan—led to “ several tens of thousands ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-zawahiri , bin laden ’ s long-time associate and future leader of al qaeda , was on one of bin laden ’ s monitored satellite phones at the time of the attack , telling bbc journalist rahumullah yusufzai that “ bin laden has a message . he says , ‘ i have not bombed the american embassies in kenya and tanzania . i have declared jihad , but i was not involved . ' ” zawahiri ’ s exact position would have been immediately detectable by american surveillance aircraft in the region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called “ inexplicable ” —the aircraft were not available prior to the strike and zawahiri escaped unscathed . bin laden , meanwhile , was—according to cia intelligence gleaned from intercepted satellite calls—going to be at his training camp in khost the day of the missile strike . but he was not . he was , clinton counter-terror czar richard clarke later speculated , tipped off about the attack by “ a retired head of the isi , ” pakistan ’ s intelligence service that had long been known as an adjunct of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two key respects , however : they kept clinton ’ s personal dalliances in the oval office from leading america ’ s nightly news broadcasts for at least one news cycle and they reinforced the importance of the new threat to global security : osama bin laden . this “ new threat ” provided a green light for the american security establishment and its allies around the world to ramp up operations in the name of fighting the al qaeda menace . the fbi began an international investigation of the bombing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting on terror threats that counter-terror officials later complained overwhelmed the system and diverted attention and resources , and in november of 1998 the united states federal court finally issued its first public indictment of osama bin laden . the first international arrest warrant for bin laden—a confidential document intended only for police and judicial authorities—had in fact already been issued in april of that year , but it was not issued by the us . instead , it was the libyan government that had issued the warrant through interpol . they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the murder of two german intelligence agents in libya in 1994 . at the time , despite publicly recognizing bin laden as the premier financier of international terrorism , the us and british governments downplayed the document , even making sure to scrub the charges against osama and any mention of libya ’ s role in issuing the document from the public record . but this surge in activity around the al qaeda threat resulted in at least one surprising development . in one of the most consequential and underreported moves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally arrested . contacted in the days after the bombing , mohamed admitted to fbi agents that he knew who had carried out the attack but would not give the government the names . subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in the southern district of new york , he was finally arrested , although even the charges against him were kept secret from the public . on october 20 , 2000 , mohamed pled guilty to involvement in the embassy bombings , but he was never sentenced . he then disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later reported as “ protective custody. ” to this day , there is no public record of ali mohamed—the ex-us sergeant and fbi asset who admitted to his key role in al qaeda—ever being sentenced . there is no public record of his incarceration . and there are only a handful of accounts that have ever surfaced from people who talked to him in prison in the aftermath of 9/11 . and , just like that , one of the deepest mysteries of the al qaeda story disappeared from public sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite all this increased activity , the same pattern of “ oversights ” and “ mistakes ” by the intelligence agencies continued unabated . on october 12 , 2000 , when a small fiberglass fishing boat approached the massive , 8,300 ton uss cole—a billion dollar guided-missile destroyer employing the latest stealth technology and armed with tomahawk cruise missiles , anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles and a five-inch canon—the sailors onboard watched in amusement . the tiny skiff stopped amidships and two men stood up , waving and smiling . then , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying over 400 pounds of c4 explosive molded into a shaped charge . the explosion was immense , knocking over cars passing by onshore . in the city , miles away , people believed there was an earthquake taking place . the blast tore a hole forty feet by forty feet in the hull of the cole , killing 17 us servicemen and injuring thirty-nine more . it was the deadliest attack on a us destroyer in over a decade . but this attack , like all of al qaeda ’ s spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceded by a string of “ missed opportunities ” and “ unheeded warnings. ” not only was there there intelligence about a potential attack on a us naval ship from several different sources—including reports from multiple informants and intercepted phone calls to al qaeda ’ s nsa-monitored yemen communications hub—but , as congressman curt weldon revealed in 2005 , a secret military intelligence operation codenamed able danger actually warned the pentagon days before the bombing that an attack was going to take place in yemen . but even after the spectacular “ failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack , and despite president clinton ’ s assurance that he would find and retaliate against the bomb plotters . . . . . . the cia repeatedly denied fbi investigators access to key information about the plot . but , it turns out , the cia did have such information . and that information—deliberately withheld from the fbi or any other investigative agency—led directly into the heart of the operation behind the next spectacular terror attack to be blamed on al qaeda : 9/11 . from the beginning , 9/11 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . osama bin laden ’ s name was raised on air by the tv news anchors within seconds of the second plane strike and was endlessly repeated in the hours and days that followed . by the end of the week , the public was convinced that the events were the work of osama bin laden and al qaeda and all of the subsequent “ investigations ” and commissions only served to bolster that pre-formed conclusion . so it was no surprise at all when , on september 14 , 2001 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hijackers , muslims with arabic names who , we were told , had been sent by bin laden on a suicide mission . but who were these men ? for the general public , the newscasters ’ solemn intonation that the nineteen hijackers had been identified , followed by a mugshot-like line up of photographs , was all that was needed to cement the case in their minds . those who required more detail turned to made-for-tv dramas and documentaries to learn about the so-called “ hamburg cell ” of radicalized al qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ziad jarrah and marwan al-shehhi , three of the alleged suicide pilots . finally , the 9/11 commission and its associated monographs—like the staff report on 9/11 and terrorist travel—attempted to fill in the paper trail for researchers concerned about the documentary record of these men , including their motivations and their movement . from these accounts , a picture emerged . these nineteen terrorists , crack operatives hand-picked by osama bin laden and trained in his terror camps in afghanistan , had used their carefully honed spycraft to slip into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as they trained at flight schools in the us and finalized the operational details of their plan . then , after years of meticulous preparation , these men , consumed by their hatred of the west , their love of allah and their devotion to bin laden—deftly piloted their planes into their targets , wreaking havoc and devastation exactly as planned . but this story , too , is a carefully constructed lie , every part of which falls apart under sustained scrutiny . in the official conspiracy theory of 9/11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslims that they were willing to give their lives for the cause . marwan al-shehhi , we were told , was so devoted to his religious beliefs that he observed the ramadan fast against medical advice after a stomach operation , causing him to fall severely ill. ziad jarrah , meanwhile , “ initially caroused and smoked ” during his early days in hamburg but “ then grew intensely religious and withdrawn. ” and , according to award-winning journalist lawrence wright , mohammed atta ’ s “ extreme rigidity of character ” made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly demonstrated an aversion to women. ” when reporters began following the trail that these supposed suicide soldiers had left behind , however , they began to uncover an altogether different story . atta and his associates frequented strip clubs in san diego , las vegas and daytona beach , where they drank alcohol and ordered lap dances . they hung out for days at a time at harry ’ s bar in new york , where atta preferred a table near the piano . and , three nights before the attack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar in fort lauderdale , where , according to bar manager tony amos , they consumed several drinks , became drunk and gave the bartender a hard time about the bill . “ the guy mohamed was drunk , his voice was slurred and he had a thick accent , ” amos told the associated press the day after 9/11 . even the new york times reported on atta and al-shehhi ’ s “ high life ” during multiple visits to the philippines between 1998 and 2000 , where the pair of strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and their girlfriends flashed money , drank and partied regularly . “ many times i saw him let a girl go at the gate in the morning , ” the times quoted one hotel chambermaid as recalling about atta . “ it was always a different girl. ” and , during his research for welcome to terrorland—an investigation into the venice , florida flight schools where mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah were enrolled in the year 2000—daniel hopsicker interviewed amanda keller , a former stripper who claimed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in venice and who shared more stories about the partying of these alleged jihadis . but hopsicker ’ s investigation uncovered more than just the alleged hijacker ’ s trail of booze , drugs and women . he also became one of the only reporters to look into the strange connections of huffman aviation and the florida flight training center in venice , florida , where atta , al-shehhi and jarrah trained the year before september 11th . huffman aviation was also the flight school that yeslam bin laden , osama ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of his acquaintances . the flight school was run by rudi dekkers , a dutch native who was running a commuter airline with wally hilliard . hilliard—the founder and former president of a green bay , wisconsin-based insurance company—made news in october 2000 when his personal jet was found to be transporting 42 pounds of heroin and was seized by federal agents in what was called the biggest drug bust in central florida history . but hilliard ’ s charter airline start-up had high-level political support : jeb bush , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ops in support of hilliard ’ s airline . dekkers , meanwhile , was arrested in 2012 , having told an undercover agent—in the words of the criminal complaint against him—that he was “ involved in narcotics transportation via private aircraft and that he has flown narcotics and u.s. currency previously without any problems. ” he was carrying over 18 kilograms of cocaine and nearly one kilogram of heroin at the time of his arrest . despite the many questions that still hang over the alleged hijackers ’ activities in venice and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegedly taking place at the venice airport , an even deeper question was soon to emerge : how did these pilots—who were rated as competent at best and who , one instructor insisted , should have been further along the flight school curriculum than they were—manage to fly jumbo jets that require thousands of hours of flying experience with such precision ? that question is even more important in the case of the other alleged 9/11 pilot , hani hanjour , the diminutive 5 foot 5 inch saudi who , the official story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top gun honor graduate chuck burlingame and his flight crew at the controls of american airlines flight 77 . according to that story , hanjour allegedly flew a boeing 757 with what aviation sources for the washington post described as “ extraordinary skill ” through a seven thousand foot spiral descent to hit the pentagon , a move that veteran airline pilot ed soliday told the 9/11 commission would be “ tough for any airline pilot , including himself , ” and which left one radar operator at dulles airport stunned : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that he turned , we all thought in the radar room , all of us experienced air traffic controllers , that that was a military plane. ” but hanjour , by all accounts , was a completely inept pilot . he dropped out of his first flight school , the sierra academy of aeronautics , after only a few classes . he then dropped out of his next school , cockpit resource management in scottsdale , arizona , after the school ’ s owner dismissed him as a “ weak student ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he returned to that school again the following year , the school owner refused , asserting : “ you ’ re never going to make it. ” an instructor at his next school , sawyer aviation , called him a “ neophyte ” who “ got overwhelmed with the instruments ” in the school ’ s flight simulator . an instructor at his next school concurred : hanjour had “ no motivation , a poor understanding of the basic principles of aviation , and poor judgment , combined with poor technical skills. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial pilot ’ s license from a for-profit contractor , the operation manager at yet another flight school in the phoenix area , peggy chevrette , told fox news that hanjour was clearly unqualified to be in the cockpit : “ i couldn ’ t believe that he had a license of any kind with the skills that he had. ” even the new york times conceded that the remarkable flight attributed to hanjour on 9/11 was inexplicable . in an article headlined “ a trainee noted for incompetence , ” the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew hanjour as saying : ” i ’ m still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the pentagon . he could not fly at all. ” whatever the case , what would eventually become the official explanation for this seeming incongruity—namely , that the single engine aircraft training and jet simulation training that they had received was good enough for these men to jump into the cockpit of commercial jet airliners and pilot them hundreds of miles to their targets—was rejected in the first hours of the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of september 15 , 2001 , provided one potential answer to this puzzle . according to a “ high-ranking us navy source ” cited by the report , “ [ t ] hree of the alleged hijackers listed their address on drivers licenses and car registrations as the naval air station in pensacola ” and , according to a separate “ high-ranking pentagon official , ” another of the alleged hijackers “ may have received language instruction at lackland air force base in san antonio. ” but this report—like the subsequent reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged hijackers turning up alive and well in the wake of 9/11 , which prompted the fbi to apologize to one mistakenly named suspect and forced fbi director robert mueller to acknowledge that they were not certain of the identities of several of the named men—were eventually dismissed as mere confusion over common arab names . on september 28 , 2001 , the fbi released the final list of names and photographs of the alleged hijackers and this rogues ’ gallery of fearsome al qaeda operatives was cemented in the public imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they really were who the fbi said they were , who directed them ? how were they supposed to have entered the united states ? how did they fund their operations ? and how did they evade detection while living openly in the us for months and in some cases years ? in the months after the attacks , we were told that the men identified by the fbi as the culprits had “ moved through europe and america unnoticed ” and that although several of them “ had been tracked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , ” they were ultimately “ lost. ” we were told that al qaeda ’ s communications had been monitored , but that bin laden and his henchman used “ scramblers , internet encryption , fiber optics ” so it was “ very hard ” to intercept those transmissions . and we were told that no one was to blame for the attacks , which had merely been a “ failure of imagination. ” but , as the public was to learn in bits and pieces over the course of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions was a demonstrable lie . this alleged team of crack al qaeda operatives did not “ move through europe and america unnoticed. ” their communications were not rendered opaque to the intelligence agencies because of “ fiber optics. ” their successful penetration of america ’ s defenses was not due to a “ failure of imagination. ” instead—as even the official story of the attacks now concedes—every major branch of us intelligence had key pieces of information on these al qaeda operatives , their communications , their movements and their plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown from official sources , these agencies not only deliberately allowed these operatives to proceed unmolested but actively stopped investigators and agents within their ranks from blowing the whistle on the plot . at the fbi , special agent robert wright led an investigation into terrorist financing called vulgar betrayal that managed to uncover a money trail connecting a suspected chicago terror cell to al qaeda . but when wright attempted to bring criminal charges against the cell ’ s members , his supervisor flew into a rage , shouting : “ you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid any of you . you will not open criminal investigations against any of these intelligence subjects. ” after the embassy bombings , when wright ’ s team began to trace the financing of the attacks to a group of saudi businessmen , the fbi moved to shut down the investigation altogether . wright was kicked off the case in 1999 and vulgar betrayal was officially shut down in 2000 . while wright was pursuing the financial trail , fbi field agents across the us were picking up on another trend : muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oklahoma and phoenix both wrote memos about the “ large numbers of middle eastern males receiving flight training ” and warned that some of them had documentable ties to al qaeda , but the warnings were ignored . agents in minneapolis frantically sought approval for a search warrant to search the laptop of zaccarias moussaoui , a suspected terrorist who had been receiving flight training in the area . when that request was denied , one exasperated agent told fbi headquarters that he was “ trying to keep someone from taking a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” rita flack , an intelligence opearations specialist at headquarters who had read the phoenix memo , failed to pass that info on to any of her colleagues involved in the decision to deny the warrant to search moussaoi ’ s laptop . fbi whistleblower colleen rowley later revealed that agents in the minneapolis office—desperately trying to find an answer to the question of why the bureau was deliberately sabotaging the case—faced the problem with gallows humour : “ i know i shouldn ’ t be flippant about this , but jokes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be spies or moles , like robert hansen , who were actually working for osama bin laden to have so undercut minneapolis ’ effort. ” the pentagon ’ s intelligence branch , meanwhile , not only had foreknowledge of the plot , but—according to information that emerged years later and was quickly suppressed—had identified four of the presumed terror operatives and mapped out the network connecting them to the brooklyn cell headed by the blind sheikh . “ able danger ” was a classified information operations campaign against transnational terrorism launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 . first revealed to the public in june 2005 , able danger employed data mining techniques on open source and classified information to identify networks of likely terror agents , including those operating in the us . the program was remarkably successful : not only did it warn the pentagon of an impending attack just days before the cole bombing , as we have already seen , but , according to defense intelligence agency ( dia ) whistleblower lt. col. anthony shaffer and four of his colleagues working on the operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells connecting al qaeda to the alleged hijackers . it even identified four of those suspects—including mohamed atta—by name . when lt. col. shaffer tried to set up a meeting between his supervisor and fbi officials in washington to discuss a collaborative approach to tracking these cells , he was rebuffed by lawyers for the pentagon ’ s special operations command . shortly thereafter , shaffer was ordered off the able danger team and the unit was disbanded , with the pentagon ordering all the able danger data—2.5 terabytes worth of information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed material in the library of congress—destroyed . after a hostile investigation that left witnesses feeling intimidated into changing their story about able danger still found five pentagon employees who said they had seen the organizational chart with atta ’ s name on it , the department of defense inspector general concluded that able danger had never identified atta or any other alleged hijacker . and , just two months after the story became public—including shaffer ’ s revelation that he had met with 9/11 commission executive director philip zelikow and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an extensive hour-long debriefing in afghanistan that did not find its way into the commission ’ s final report—the dia stripped shaffer of his security clearance , essentially ending his decades-long career as a military intelligence officer . the nsa , meanwhile—despite the “ scrambler and fiber optics ” excuses of the agency ’ s apologists—were monitoring all of the communications going through al qaeda ’ s pivotal yemen communications hub from the lead-up to the embassy bombings straight through to the execution of 9/11 itself . this “ communications hub ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping into and transcribing the satellite phone calls of bin laden—was , in fact , the home of ahmed al-hada , one of the jihadis who had fought alongside bin laden against the soviets in afghanistan in the 1980s . hada ’ s phone was used by various al qaeda-linked operatives to pass messages to each other , as some countries blocked or monitored calls to other countries as possible terrorist communications . the nsa listened as mohamed al-owhali , one of the bombers involved in the embassy attack , made multiple calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . they listened as al qaeda operatives called the hub to discuss attacking a us warship in the months prior to the cole bombing . and they listened as numerous terror suspects called to discuss their operations with khalid al-mihdhar , one of the alleged 9/11 hijackers and the son-in-law of ahmed al-hada . thomas drake was a decorated united states air force and united states navy veteran with a background in military crypto-electronics who had worked for twelve years as an outside contractor at the nsa . 9/11 was his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , and it was in the wake of that attack that he was handed a report from one of his colleagues in the nsa ’ s “ counterterror shop ” that laid out the agency ’ s role in the events of that day . according to drake , the report was “ an extraordinarily detailed long-term study of al qaeda ’ s activities ” that identified “ the planning cells ” for 9/11 , including “ a number of the hijackers based on actual copy : atta , hazmi , mihdhar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nsa ’ s radar by the start of 2001 . it also contained specific warnings about 9/11 . drake immediately gave the document to his supervisor , maureen baginski , who told him : “ tom , i wish you had not brought this to my attention. ” he was subsequently forced out of his position , stripped of his security clearance and indicted under the espionage act . on the day of the attacks , knowing the information that the nsa had that could have foiled the plot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffers suffered heart attacks , with one dying . another , a female analyst who had been responsible for monitoring the yemen hub communications , left nsa headquarters after suffering what drake was told was a nervous breakdown . yet another , a 40-something man , began openly crying in a hallway , telling three women he was talking to in full view of everyone passing : “ we knew this was being planned months ago , but they would not let us issue the reports we wrote. ” nsa leadership , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the sigint division , maureen baginski , had a different reaction to the events unfolding that morning . in fact , the story of intelligence agency foreknowledge of the plot goes from the merely impossible to the outright absurd when it is revealed that it wasn ’ t just us intelligence that had a window into the plot , but every major intelligence service in the world . in subsequent years , it has emerged that intelligence agencies in indonesia , the uk , germany , italy , egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , israel had all passed on various warnings about an imminent attack in the months and years leading up to 9/11 . and , infamously , the president received a classified intelligence briefing on august 6 , 2001 , that unequivocally stated that an attack was being prepared . it ’ s no surprise that this plot—the most important ever attempted by al qaeda—would have been known by so many . not only did the men that ( we are told ) bin laden hand-picked for the operation make no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , they instead—in the words of some investigators—left a deliberate trail behind them , a trail that was picked up and extensively reported on in the immediate wake of the attacks . perhaps the greatest clue as to the real nature of the 9/11 operation , however , is found in one of the most stunning pieces of evidence of direct intelligence agency complicity in the plot . in the years after the attack , it was revealed that the cia were not just surveilling the supposed hijackers or gathering information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these men ’ s travels from reaching other intelligence agencies , deliberately hiding the fact that two of these agents had entered the us and were openly living in the country from the fbi and even from the national security council itself for over one and a half years . this incredible fact , buried in footnote 44 of chapter 6 of the 9/11 commission report , was no trivial detail . 9/11 commission chair thomas kean called it “ one of the most troubling aspects of our entire report. ” white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evidence of both cia malfeasance and misfeasance . and mark rossini , an fbi agent assigned to the cia ’ s bin laden unit , believed it to be part of a secret intelligence operation involving these supposed terrorist hijackers that the agency didn ’ t want anyone to discover . shortly after the cole bombing , fahad al-quso , a yemeni with known links to osama bin laden , was interrogated by yemeni agents and admitted that he had flown from yemen to bangkok the previous january to deliver $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrorist based in malaysia who quso identified as the bombing mastermind . the money , quso said , was to buy this one-legged terror mastermind an artificial leg . but ali soufan—the head of the fbi investigation into the cole bombing—was puzzled by this lead . why was al qaeda transferring money out of yemen when they were supposedly planning an attack in that country ? was this money for a different operation ? as with every such lead , soufan followed up with an official request to the cia for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in malaysia or the phone number that quso had used to contact him there . the cia never responded to any of these official requests . on december 29 , 1999—with all of the us intelligence services on heightened alert due to the threat of millennium terror attacks—the nsa shares information from their wiretap of al qaeda ’ s yemen communications hub with the cia : khalid al-mihdhar , nawaf alhazmi , and salem alhazmi will be flying to malaysia to attend an important al qaeda summit the following month . the cia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to the yemen communications hub , tasks agents from eight cia offices and six friendly foreign intelligence services with tracking his travel to malaysia . the surveillance operation is successful . when al-mihdhar changes planes in dubai , the cia obtains a copy of his passport . inside is a vital piece of information : this known bin laden associate , on his way to an al qaeda summit , has a visa to enter the united states . a visa that was issued at the same jeddah consulate where , michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure visas for osama bin laden ’ s men during the afghan-soviet war . seasoned intelligence officials have no trouble understanding the importance of this fact . reflecting on the incredible nature of this series of events years later , veteran fbi agent jack cloonan remarked : “ how often do you get into someone ’ s suitcase and find multiple-entry visas ? and how often do you know there ’ s going to be an organizational meeting of al qaeda any place in the world ? the chances are slim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets . it ’ s a home run in the ninth inning of the world series . this is the kind of case you hope your whole life for. ” what happened next is so inexplicable for purveyors of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory that it is typically never discussed . after scoring this once-in-a-lifetime intelligence coup—this “ home run in the ninth inning of the world series ” —the cia then failed to watchlist either al-mihdhar or alhazmi , allegedly lost track of them after they went on from malaysia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel where they stayed in bangkok ) and failed to inform fbi investigators like ali soufan that these known terror associates had been tracked to an al qaeda summit . most incredibly of all , the official record shows that supervisors in the cia ’ s bin laden unit repeatedly and deliberately stopped agents from sending info about al-mihdhar ’ s us visa to the fbi . on january 5th , 2000 , while the summit was still underway in kuala lumpur , the cia ’ s riyadh station forwarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alec station at langley . doug miller—an fbi officer assigned to the bin laden unit as part of an intelligence sharing program between the cia and the fbi—read the cable and , following protocol , immediately drafted a memo asking for permission to forward the info to fbi headquarters . the reply from his cia supervisor , michael anne casey , citing alex station ’ s deputy chief , tom wilshere , was immediate and unequivocal : “ this is not a matter for the fbi. ” thus began an 18-month odyssey in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and not one of them ever officially shared it with any fbi or national security council official , even then-counterterrorism czar richard clarke . on its own , this is scarcely believable . the central intelligence agency actively and deliberately made a decision to stop the automatic sharing of information on the most sensitive national security intelligence in their possession . on september 12 , 2001 , when the cia finally granted ali soufan ’ s request from nearly one year before and sent him their intelligence about the malaysia meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , vomiting on the floor next to the toilet . when one of his colleagues asked him what had happened , he said : “ they knew , they knew. ” but neither soufan nor anyone else familiar with the hidden history of al qaeda should be surprised . when put into its context , this episode is a perfectly predictable continuation of the same pattern of intelligence agency aid that , as we have seen , defines the story of al qaeda . it is sometimes said that in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence agencies have to get everything right all the time whereas the terrorists only have to get lucky once . but the al qaeda “ terrorists ” —protected , shepherded and aided by the intelligence agencies as they demonstrably were—did not get lucky once . they got lucky over and over and over again , time after time after time , year after year after year from their earliest beginnings through their development and growth , through their rise to international prominence , through every major terrorist attack of the 1990s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . at this point , the “ incompetence ” theory of “ failures ” and “ missed opportunities ” is not only not supportable , it is a transparent falsehood . there is only one conclusion possible : these “ terrorists ” were deliberately aided . this is not fringe conspiracy thinking . even richard clarke eventually came to this conclusion . that the former top-ranking counterterrorism official in the united states has publicly accused the former director of the cia and other top cia officials of running an operation involving the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation and information about it up to and through 9/11—an incredible accusation recorded by two independent filmmakers and freely viewable on youtube for the past decade—is apparently of so little importance that it has never been followed up on by any major media outlet . but clarke ’ s version of the story , explosive as it is—that these accused terrorists really were terrorists , that they , like ali mohamed , managed to triple cross the intelligence agencies that were trying to use them as double agents against al qaeda , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies up to and including the director of the cia engaged in a cover up of the entire affair , indirectly allowing 9/11 to take place purely to save their own skin—demonstrably can not be the full story . as we now know , these nineteen men were no devout islamic fundamentalists driven by their devotion into striking against the infidels . these alcohol-drinking , strip club-attending bumblers who , at one point , lived with an fbi informant and who left what investigators described as a deliberate trail behind them were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cia . they did not coordinate their plan to coincide precisely with the live fly highjacking exercises , military war games and planes-into-buildings training drills that were taking place on the day of 9/11 . they did not overpower the military-trained pilots on four separate planes before a single one of them could so much as send out a hijack signal . they did not know to commit those hijackings precisely in the highly-classified radar gaps that made their planes ’ movements opaque to flight traffic controllers . they did not pilot those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called “ tough for any airline pilot ” despite never having sat in the cockpit of a jumbo jet before . they did not cause three buildings to pulverize themselves in mid-air , falling directly through the path of most resistance at freefall gravitational acceleration with two planes . they did not decide to fly around the pentagon to miss the defense secretary ’ s office and instead hit the section of the building where bookkeepers and budget analysts were working on the problem of the $ 2.3 trillion that donald rumsfeld had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accounted for in the defence department ’ s budget . they did not commit the informed trading that three separate academic studies have proven did take place in the run up to 9/11 . they did not engage in the decades-long cover up of these facts in the wake of that attack . and they did not launch the war of terror that sometimes saw the us and its allies using al qaeda as a convenient excuse for aggression in foreign countries and other times saw them actively collaborating with al qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . richard clarke ’ s story is itself a cover up . the spectacular , catalyzing terror attack of 9/11 was not allowed to happen . it was made to happen . but why ? who , other than the devout muslim suicide warriors posited by the official 9/11 conspiracy theorists , would do such a thing ? and for what purpose ? to answer these questions , we need to return to operation susannah and the false flag terror ruse that has been employed by the british , the israelis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall see , just eight years after operation susannah failed in egypt , the highest-ranking officials in the us military drafted plans to stage terror attacks , blow up airliners and even kill americans in order to blame their political enemies . and in the lead up to 9/11 a cadre of political operatives brought those plans into the 21st century , paving the way for a new pearl harbor that would begin a worldwide war of

         "black and brown americans biggest losers in 50-year war on drugs. landscaping was hardly his lifelong dream . as a teenager , alton lucas believed basketball or music would pluck him out of north carolina and take him around the world . in the late 1980s , he was the right-hand man to his musical best friend , youtha anthony fowler , who many hip hop and r & b heads know as dj nabs . but rather than jet-setting with fowler , lucas discovered drugs and the drug trade at the height of the so-called war on drugs . addicted to crack cocaine and involved in trafficking the drug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the drug abuse and violence plaguing major cities and working class black communities were not seen as the public health issue that opioids are today . by chance , lucas received a rare bit of mercy . he got the kind of help that many black and latino americans struggling through the crack epidemic did not : treatment , early release and what many would consider a fresh start . “ i started the landscaping company , to be honest with you , because nobody would hire me because i have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunflower landscaping got a boost in 2019 with the help of inmates to entrepreneurs , a national nonprofit assisting people with criminal backgrounds by providing practical entrepreneurship education . lucas was caught up in a system that imposes lifetime limits on most people who have served time for drug crimes , with little thought given to their ability to rehabilitate . in addition to being denied employment , those with criminal records can be limited in their access to business and educational loans , housing , child custody rights , voting rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that was born when lucas was barely out of diapers . fifty years ago this summer , president richard nixon declared a war on drugs . today , with the u.s. mired in a deadly opioid epidemic that did not abate during the coronavirus pandemic ’ s worst days , it is questionable whether anyone won the war . yet the loser is clear : black and latino americans , their families and their communities . a key weapon was the imposition of mandatory minimums in prison sentencing . decades later those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the prison industrial complex that saw millions of people , primarily of color , locked up and shut out of the american dream . an associated press review of federal and state incarceration data shows that , between 1975 and 2019 , the u.s. prison population jumped from 240,593 to 1.43 million americans . among them , about 1 in 5 people were incarcerated with a drug offense listed as their most serious crime . the racial disparities reveal the war ’ s uneven toll . following the passage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , the black incarceration rate in america exploded from about 600 per 100,000 people in 1970 to 1,808 in 2000 . in the same timespan , the rate for the latino population grew from 208 per 100,000 people to 615 , while the white incarceration rate grew from 103 per 100,000 people to 242 . gilberto gonzalez , a retired special agent for the drug enforcement administration who worked for more than 20 years taking down drug dealers and traffickers in the u.s. , mexico and in south america , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by residents in a predominantly hispanic neighborhood near los angeles as he led away drug traffickers in handcuffs . “ that gave me a sense of the reality of the people that live in these neighborhoods , that are powerless because they ’ re afraid that the drug dealers that control the street , that control the neighborhood are going to do them and their children harm , ” said gonzalez , 64 , who detailed his field experiences in the recently released memoir “ narco legenda. ” “ we realized then that @ @ @ @

to many long-lasting consequences for people who have since reformed . lucas still wonders what would happen for him and his family if he no longer carried the weight of a drug-related conviction on his record . even with his sunny disposition and close to 30 years of sober living , lucas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most criminal background checks . his wife , whom he ’ d met two decades ago at a fatherhood counseling conference , said his past had barred him from doing things as innocuous as chaperoning their children on school field trips . “ it ’ s almost like a life sentence , ” he said . although

leveraged drug war policies in the following decades to their own political advantage , cementing the drug war ’ s legacy . the explosion of the u.s. incarceration rate , the expansion of public and private prison systems and the militarization of local police forces are all outgrowths of the drug war . federal policies , such as mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses , were mirrored in state legislatures . lawmakers also adopted felony disenfranchisement , while also imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in drug sweeps . the domestic anti-drug policies were widely accepted , mostly because the use of illicit drugs , including crack cocaine in the late 1980s , was accompanied by an alarming spike in homicides and other violent crimes nationwide . those policies had the backing of black clergy and the congressional black caucus , the group of african-american lawmakers whose constituents demanded solutions and resources to stem the violent heroin and crack scourges . “ i think people often flatten this conversation , ” said kassandra frederique , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new york-based nonprofit organization pushing decriminalization and safe drug use policies . “ if you ’

'' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are self-identified pedophiles . the idea is that with support , these `` minor attracted persons '' can be `` committed to never offending . '' timothy n. fury , writing for prostasia , says that for pedophiles , '' the most common struggle is not with child sexual abuse images , '' and that many of these people are looking `` for recommendations on where to get professional help . '' while fury writes that `` some minor-attracted people do struggle with viewing sexually harmful images , and they are provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for fury , this is personal ; `` ... these people are not the majority of us , '' he writes . `` no , the majority of us struggle with basic mental health issues—some diagnosed , some not—and just need a place to talk about things they feel they can never talk to friends and family members about . many of these minor attracted people are children themselves . '' fury 's piece is just one in defense of pedophilia as a predilection . berlatsky promotes the work of uc berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people who trade sex do n't see themselves as victims , lutnick emphasizes . they often see themselves as resourceful individuals who are doing what they need to survive in difficult circumstances . '' berlatsky writes for prostasia that there 's an issue with the term `` trafficking '' itself , saying that it `` conflates underage people trading sex , consensual sex work , immigration , and all kinds of labor exploitation in all industries . '' he claims that to use the word trafficking for child sex trafficking is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to target sex workers rather than labor exploitation . '' she uncovered a tweet from dr. james cantor , part of the prostasia team , who advocates for the idea that pedophilia is an innate condition , in which he said that pedophiles should be included in the lgbt identity alphabet . cantor wrote : `` speaking as a gay man , i believe we should include the p. to do otherwise is to betray the principles that give us our rights . '' for cantor , pedophilia is just another kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing policies to protect children from sexual abuse does more harm than good . they say that they undertake to `` reduce the separate harms caused to children and others by our society 's predominantly reactive child protection agenda . '' as for `` sex worker rights , '' prostasia states that they are `` strongly opposed to minors engaging in any kind of sex work , '' but they have concerns that measure to combat child sex trafficking `` target all sex workers in the name of protecting those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportionate and infringe the rights of adult sex workers . '' berlatsky seems to see little difference between sex work and other kinds of work , saying that the `` lots of jobs require people to barter their health and their bodies , '' and comparing sex workers to people who work in mines . he calls children who have been trafficked into the sex trade `` young people trading in sex , '' and believes that the key way to help them is to deal with the root causes that led them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the crime of sex trafficking itself ."

from the department of justice—turn police officers into roving surveillance cameras . of course , if you try to request access to that footage , you ’ ll find yourself being led a merry and costly chase through miles of red tape , bureaucratic footmen and unhelpful courts . the “ internet of things ” refers to the growing number of “ smart ” appliances and electronic devices now connected to the internet and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled remotely . these range from thermostats and coffee makers to cars and tvs . of course , there ’ s a price to pay for such easy control and access . that price amounts to relinquishing ultimate control of and access to your home to the government and its corporate partners . for example , while samsung ’ s smart tvs are capable of “ listening ” to what you say , thereby allowing users to control the tv using voice commands , it also records everything you say and relays it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . then again , the government doesn ’ t really need to spy on you using your smart tv when the fbi can remotely activate the microphone on your cellphone and record your conversations . the fbi can also do the same thing to laptop computers without the owner knowing any better . drones , which are taking to the skies en masse , are the converging point for all of the weapons and technology already available to law enforcement agencies . in fact , drones can listen in on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your home , scan your biometrics , photograph you and track your movements , and even corral you with sophisticated weaponry . all of these technologies add up to a society in which there ’ s little room for indiscretions , imperfections , or acts of independence , especially not when the government can listen in on your phone calls , monitor your driving habits , track your movements , scrutinize your purchases and peer through the walls of your home . these digital trails are everywhere . as investigative journalists charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ this data—collected by smartphone apps and then fed into a dizzyingly complex digital advertising ecosystem … provided an intimate record of people whether they were visiting drug treatment centers , strip clubs , casinos , abortion clinics or places of worship. ” in such a surveillance ecosystem , we ’ re all suspects and databits to be tracked , catalogued and targeted . as i point out in my book battlefield america : the war on the american people , this is the creepy , calculating yet diabolical genius of the american @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed as revolutionary and liberating has become our prison , jailer , probation officer , big brother and father knows best all rolled into one . there is no gray area any longer ."
