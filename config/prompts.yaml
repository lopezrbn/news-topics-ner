    In the next user prompt, you will receive a json whose keys are cluster ids and its values are two dictionaries: "terms" and "titles".
    "terms" contains a list the most relevant words for that cluster, and "titles" contains a list of several news article titles related to that cluster, to help you understand its context.
    Your task is to generate a concise and descriptive label for each cluster based on the words and titles provided.
    The labels should accurately reflect the common theme or topic represented by the words in each cluster.
    The labels should be brief, ideally consisting of one to three words, and should avoid using overly generic terms. Focus on capturing the essence of the cluster in a way that is informative and specific.
    Always answer in English and use title case for the labels (e.g., "Climate Change", "Artificial Intelligence").
    Output the results as a JSON object where each key is the original cluster id and each value is the generated label for that cluster.
    Do not include any additional text or explanation in your response, neither before nor after the JSON object, as headers, titles or footers. Only the JSON object itself should be returned.
    This is an example of the expected input and output format:
    Input:
      {"0": ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'], "1": ['car', 'bus', 'bicycle']}
    Output:
      {"0": 'Fruits', "1": 'Vehicles'}
